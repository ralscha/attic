About

Velocity Cracking Utilities (VCU) is a suite of utilities to aid in cracking UNIX password files.
This is accomplished with tools that create and manipulate wordlists, as well as some front-ends
for popular DOS based cracking programs. VCU attempts to make the cracking of passwords a simple
task for computer users of any experience level. VCU was written by me, Epicurus. Velocity
Cracking Utilities is Copyright © 1998-1999 Epicurus (epicurus@wilter.com). Velocity Cracking
Utilities is a Wiltered Fire production.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generate Single Password

This function is designed to aid in the choosing of 'secure' passwords by creating random 
passwords with user-definable attributes. By generating a random password, it is easy to avoid 
the common pit-falls of choosing a weak password. To use this feature, simply run the "Generate
Single Password" option from the main user interface, choose a type of password to create by 
selecting from the drop-down list, choose a password length, and click the "Generate" button.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generate Random Wordlist

This function is made to create random wordlists with user-definable attributes. The wordlists 
this function generates can be used when attempting to crack password files. The options of this
feature are quite similar to the Generate Single Password function. To use this feature, simply
run the "Generate Random Wordlist" option from the main user interface, choose a type of wordlist
to generate from the drop-down list, choose a word length, a number of words to generate, and an
output file and click the "Generate" button.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Convert Text File to Wordlist

This function is a neat utility to harvest words from text files to use for wordlists. When 
converting a text file to a wordlist, it grabs each and every unique word from the text file and
puts it in a sorted wordlist. To use this function, simply run the "Convert Text File to 
Wordlist" option from the main interface, choose a text file to convert and a file to output to,
then hit the "Convert" button.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merge Wordlists

This function is designed to aid in the merging of mutliple wordlists into one 'master' wordlist.
When lists are merged together, all output is sorted and duplicate entries are removed from the
output. To use this function, simply run the "Merge Wordlists" option from the main interface,
use the "+" button to add two or more wordlists (and the "-" button to remove them) from the
list, choose an output file, and click the "Merge" button.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sort Wordlist

This feature is a simple feature to sort all entries in a wordlist alpha-numerically. To use this
function, simply run the "Sort Wordlist" option from the main interface, choose an unsorted 
(input) file, and a sorted (output) file and click the "Sort" button.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reverse Wordlist

This function is designed to reverse every word in a wordlist. The line "abcdefg" in an input 
file would be reversed as "gfedcba" in the output file. To use this feature, simply run the 
"Reverse Wordlist" function from the main interface, choose a normal (input) file, and a reversed
(output) file, and click the "Reverse" button.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Truncate Wordlist

This function is used to truncate all words in a given list to a given length. To use this 
function, simply run "Truncate Wordlist" from the main interface, choose a normal (input)
wordlist, a length to truncate to, a truncated (output) file, choose whether or not to sort
output and remove duplicates, and click the "Truncate" button. NOTE: Duplicates cannot be removed
without sorting the output.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strip Wordlist

This feature is designed to strip certain words from lists based on their length. You can choose
whether to strip words longer than, shorter than, or not equal in length to a certain number of
characters. This can be quite usefull if you know certain things about a password (or password
file) that you're trying to crack, such as the minimum and maximum password lengths allowed on 
the system. To use this feature, simply run "Strip Wordlist" from the main interface, choose a
normal (input) wordlist, a stripped (output) file, the stripping options, whether or not to sort
output and remove duplicate entries, and click the "Strip" button.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manipulate Wordlist Cases

This feature is designed to aid in manipulating wordlist cases. It gives you the options to
change the first or last character of every word in a list to lower or upper case, or change each
entire word to upper or lower case. To use this feature, simply run the "Manipulate Wordlist
Cases" option from the main interface, choose an input wordlist, the type of manipulation you
desire, and output file, and click the "Manipulate" button.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unshadow Password File

This feature is simply used to unshadow a password file when both the passwd file and shadow file
are available. This works by simply merging the encrypted passwords from the shadow file with the
rest of the password line in the passwd file. To use this, you must have both the shadow and
passwd files. To use this feature, simply run the "Unshadow Password File" option from the main
interface, choose your shadowed password file, the shadow file, the output "passwd" file, and
click the "Unshadow" button.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run John The Ripper v1.0 Visually

This is one of the neatest features of these utilities. A Windows front-end to one of the most 
popular password crackers around. Most of the features and options of John The Ripper v1.0 are
implimented in this front-end, but not every single one. For explanations of all the options,
read the documentation that comes with John The Ripper. A front-end for John The Ripper v1.6 is
also included in these utilities, but v1.0 was kept because it seems to be the most widely
distributed password cracker around.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run John The Ripper v1.6 Visually

This is one of the neatest features of these utilities. A Windows front-end to one of the most
popular password crackers around. Most of the features and options of John The Ripper v1.6 are
implimented in this front-end, but not every single one. For explanations of all the options,
read the documentation that comes with John The Ripper. A front-end for John The Ripper v1.0 is
also included in these utilities, because v1.0 seems to be the most widely distributed password
cracker around.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run Brute v1.1 Visually

This feature is a front-end to one of the more simple, yet popular DOS based password crackers.
For information on the options, refer to the documentation that comes with Brute v1.1.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run XiT v2.2 Visually

This feature is a front-end to one of the most simple DOS based password crackers. For 
information on the options, refer to the documentation that comes with XiT v2.0. NOTE: slight 
modifications must be made xit.bat for this to run propperly under windows, a modified copy of
xit.bat should be located within the VCU distribution.
