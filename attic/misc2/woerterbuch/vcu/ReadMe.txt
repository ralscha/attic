Overview

Velocity Cracking Utilities (VCU) is a suite of utilities to aid in cracking UNIX password files.
This is accomplished with tools that create and manipulate wordlists, as well as some front-ends
for popular DOS based cracking programs. VCU attempts to make the cracking of passwords a simple
task for computer users of any experience level. VCU was written by me, Epicurus. Velocity
