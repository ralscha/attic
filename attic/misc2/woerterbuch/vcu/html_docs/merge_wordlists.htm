This function is designed to aid in the merging of mutliple wordlists into one 'master' wordlist.
When lists are merged together, all output is sorted and duplicate entries are removed from the
output. To use this function, simply run the "Merge Wordlists" option from the main interface, use
the "+" button to add two or more wordlists (and the "-" button to remove them) from the list, choose
an output file, and click the "Merge" button.
