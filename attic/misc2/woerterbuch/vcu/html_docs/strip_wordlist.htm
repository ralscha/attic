This feature is designed to strip certain words from lists based on their length. You can choose
whether to strip words longer than, shorter than, or not equal in length to a certain number of
characters. This can be quite usefull if you know certain things about a password (or password file)
that you're trying to crack, such as the minimum and maximum password lengths allowed on the system.
To use this feature, simply run "Strip Wordlist" from the main interface, choose a normal (input)
wordlist, a stripped (output) file, the stripping options, whether or not to sort output and
remove duplicate entries, and click the "Strip" button.
