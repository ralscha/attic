This feature is simply used to unshadow a password file when both the passwd file and shadow file
are available. This works by simply merging the encrypted passwords from the shadow file with the
rest of the password line in the passwd file. To use this, you must have both the shadow and passwd
files. To use this feature, simply run the "Unshadow Password File" option from the main interface,
choose your shadowed password file, the shadow file, the output "passwd" file, and click the "Unshadow"
button.
