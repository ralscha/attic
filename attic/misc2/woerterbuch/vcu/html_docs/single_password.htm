This function is designed to aid in the choosing of 'secure' passwords by creating random passwords
with user-definable attributes. By generating a random password, it is easy to avoid the common 
pit-falls of choosing a weak password. To use this feature, simply run the "Generate Single Password"
option from the main user interface, choose a type of password to create by selecting from the drop-down
list, choose a password length, and click the "Generate" button.
