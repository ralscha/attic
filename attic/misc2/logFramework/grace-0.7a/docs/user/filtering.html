<h2>Introduction</h2>

JavaLog code is meant to remain in your source code forever.  In other
words, it should not be removed for production, like print statements.
So to make this efficient, JavaLog provides a runtime filtering system
that allows the runtime user to selectively include and exclude events
based on regular expression pattern matching.

<P>JavaLog uses the <a href="http://www.cacas.org/~wes/java">GNU
regular expression library</a> to express runtime filtering patterns.
Events are filtered in two passes.  In the first pass, the event type
is filtered using a Hashtable lookup.  This is very fast so that users
can efficiently filter in and out event types that are not pertinent
to the mode of operation of the software.  In the second pass, other
attributes of an event can be used in include/exlude criteria.  This
pass is slower since each include/exlude criterion is evaluated
against each event.

<P>The remainder of this page describes how to filter JavaLog events
at runtime using regular expressions.

<h2>Event Type Filtering</h2>

Event type filtering can be accomplished at compile time and and run
time using one ore more <i>filters</i>.  A filter is simply a regular
expression.  In both run time and compile time cases, a collection of
filters is specified as a string of space separated regular
expressions.  Obviously, this means that a filter can not contain a
space.  So, a filter like: "<b>err.* s.*</b>" means all events whose
type begins with "err" or "s".  Currently, filters can be
<i>include></i> filters or <i>exclude</i> filters. Include filters are
filters that pass the a potential event to the handlers and, thus, are
logged.  Exclude filters stop a potential event from being passed to
the handlers and, thus, are not logged.

<P>Include filters are, by default, set to include everything, ".*",
and exclude filters are, by default, set to exclude nothing, "".  If
an include filter is then set, it replaces the default ".*" pattern.
Also, note that the default include filter is affected by the <a
href="properties/log.html">-Dlog=false</a> properties.  If this
property is set false, the default include pattern is set to include
nothing, ".*".

<P>Compile time filtering is accomplished using the <a
href=../api/grace/log/Log.html#setEventTypesToInclude(java.lang.String)>
<code>Log.setEventsTypesToInclude(String filter)</code></a>

and

<a href=../api/grace/log/Log.html#setEventTypesToExclude(java.lang.String)>
<code>setEventTypesToExclude(String filter)</code></a> functions of the Log.

<P>Run time filtering is accomplished using the 
<a href="properties/event.include.html">-Dlog.event.include</a>=<i>filters</i>
and
<a href="properties/event.exclude.html">-Dlog.event.exclude</a>=<i>filters</i>
properties.  

The following unrealistic example,

<pre>java -Dlog.event.include="error.*" -Dlog.event.exclude="error1.*"</pre>

would include all events whose type starts with "error" but then
exlude those that started with "error1".

<h2>Function Filtering</h2>

Functions are filtered almost identically to the event types.  They
are filtered by the funtions:

<a href=../api/grace/log/Log.html#setFunctionsToInclude(java.lang.String)>
<code>Log.setFunctionsToInclude(String filter)</code></a>

and

<a href=../api/grace/log/Log.html#setFunctionsToExclude(java.lang.String)>
<code>setFunctionsToExclude(String filter)</code></a> functions of the Log.

or at runtime using the properties 
<a href="properties/function.include.html">-Dlog.function.include</a>=
<i>filters</i>
and
<a href="properties/function.exclude.html">-Dlog.function.exclude</a>=
<i>filters</i> properties.
