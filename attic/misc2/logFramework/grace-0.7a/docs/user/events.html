<h2>Introduction</h2>

An item logged in JavaLog is called an <b>event</b>.  An event
encapsulates the time, stack trace, message, and object as well as an
event type string.  An event type is one word that indicates the
general catagory of the event.  Event types are one of the ways events
can be <a href="filtering.html">filtered</a> in JavaLog so it is
important to design the event types assigned to an event carefully.

<p>JavaLog events are initiated by calling one of the
<code>Log.log(String type, ...)</code> functions.  Some common event
types have been broken out as separate functions so the event type
argument does not have to be passed.  These are <i>error, warning,
notice,</i> and <i>trace</i>.

<P>The remainder of this document shows how to use JavaLog to log
various common conditions in code.

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
  
    <P>Typically, the programmer doesn't know exactly how to handle
    some exceptions while the code is being developed and tested.  So,
    instead of simply calling
    <code>Exception.printStackTrace()</code>, using the exception
    logging functionality allows is easier and allows the extensive
    runtime control of JavaLog.  The following is a the best way to
    handle exceptions:

    <pre>
    try {
        ... code that throws an exception ...
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        Log.error(e);
    }
    </pre>

    <P>Now, rather that simply log the fact that an exception
    occurred, it is better to log the context under which the
    exception has occurred.  However, since JavaLog logs automatically
    the class, function, and line number in which the exception
    occurred, the programmer should try to offer a more meaning full
    explanation of why the error occurred.

    <P>This high level description of the exception takes the form a
    string message that could contain two pieces of information:
    <ul>
    <li>the probable cause of the exception
    <li>how the code handled the exception.  Here are some possible
    words to describe this:

        <table BORDER>
	<tr>
	<td><b>ignored</b></td> <td>Exception indicates an expected erroreous
	condition but one that leaves the program in a known runnable
	state.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>aborted</b></td> <td>Like <i>ignored</i> but indicates
	that the entire operation causing the exception was
	stopped.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>confused</b> or <b>impossible</b></td> <td>The
	programmer has determined that the condition under which the
	exception occurred is "impossible" but he was forced to handle
	the exception.  If this exception occurs, it indicates that
	programmer didn't anticipate the condition and means,
	therefore, that the program may be in an foul or unrecoverable
	state.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td><b>fatal</b></td> <td>The exception is not handlable and
	the program will be terminated.</td>
	</tr>

	 </table>

	 <P>So, a useful handled exception could look like this:
         <pre></code>
	 try { ... }
	 catch (Exception e) { Log.error("ignored"); }
    
         <i>or</i>

	 try { ... }
	 catch (Exception e) { Log.error("invalid input; aborted", e); }
	 </code></pre>
    </ul>

<h2>Errors and Warnings</h2>

Errors and Warnings that are not caused by an exception are also
useful in the log.  In this case, the condition is determined and
logged with only a message.

<pre><code>
if (...) 
    Log.warning("something is wrong on Saturn 3"); }
</code></pre>

<h2>Notices</h2>

Notices are useful for printing out messages or objects that are a
normal part of program's output but are not used for debugging.  This
is useful if the program has no GUI and simply wants to print results
to the log.

<pre><code>
Log.notice("original", orignalVector); }
Log.notice("sorted", sortedVector); }
</code></pre>

<P>Note in the above two examples that when objects are logged, the
name of the object must also be passed to the logging function.

<h2>Traces</h2>

Traces are typically used during program debugging, testing, or
performance analysis.  Then, during productive runs of the software
they can be turned off or partially filtered to reduce the noisy log
output.

<pre><code>
Log.trace("object", object); }
</code></pre>


<h2>User defined</h2>

Log messages can have other event types than the error, warning,
pnotice, and trace.  The user can specify any type in the more general
call to the logging functions that takes an event type as the first
argument:

<pre><code>
Log.log("statistic", "object", object); }
</code></pre>

<P>The above example would log an object with event type "statistic".
Any string can be used for the event type.  User defined event types
are usefule for many purposes because they add a more rich symantic
meaning to the event and can be easily and quickly filtered in and out
at runtime.  

<P>Older logging systems indicate the meaning of a log events with
integer level numbers.  This practice can be continued here as well.
Sinply specify the event type as a number:

<pre><code>
Log.log("42", "object", object); }
</code></pre>

<P>Then, the <a href="filtering.html">runtime filtering mechanism</a>
can be used to filter in or out specific levels and a series of
levels.  However, since JavaLog allows text event types, it is a shame
not to use.  Numbered levels do not provide a symantically rich logs
and therefore require a paper lookup table to translate to the text
description.

<h2>Legacy System.out.print() Integration</h2>

    If you are porting code that uses <code>System.out.print()</code>
    statements, you can still use some of the features of JavaLog
    without changing the code.  JavaLog can be installed as the
    <code>System.out or err</code> stream such that all uses of the
    the <code>System.out or err</code> will be routed through JavaLog.

    <P>Here's how.  Before making any calls to <code>System.out or
    err</code>, instaniate and install the special
    java.log.StandardOutWriter:

    <pre>
    import grace.log.PrintCatcher;
    ...
    public static void main(String[] args) 
        System.setOut(new PrintCatcher(Log.NOTICE), System.out);
        System.setErr(new PrintCatcher(Log.ERROR), System.err);
	...
	System.out.println("some text that now goes to JavaLog");
	System.err.println("some error text that now goes to JavaLog");
    }
    </pre>

    <P>Doing this, allows you to use your existing code with print
    statements but still use indirection, formatting, and filtering of
    JavaLog.  Currently, this functionality is experimental but will
    improve over time.  Of course, it is better to use the actual
    JavaLog interfaces.
