<h2>Introduction</h2>

JavaLog can be configured to run in different process models.  This
document describes three main process models that can be used in
JavaLog.

<ul>
<li>Standalone
<li>Centralized
<li>Distributed
</ul>

<h2>Standalone</h2>

By default, JavaLog is configured to run in a single JVM and produce
logging output on the standard output.

<h2>Centralized</h2>

This is also called the client/server configuration.  This
configuration is characterized by one ore more client applications
sending their log events to a central server process that presumably
combines all of the client log events into a single output.  The
advantage of this configuration is that the events of all of the
virtual machines in the system are routed through a single
application.  This makes it much easier to diagnose problems and
analyse an entire systems behavior.

<P>All of the class necessary to demonstrate a simple client/server
configuration are included in JavaLog.  Of course, these classes can
be modified or rewritten to suit the users needs.  The following 3
classes implement the basic system:

<ul>
<li><a href=../api/grace/log/test/centralized/Server.html>grace.log.test.centralized.Server</a> 
<li><a href=../api/grace/log/test/centralized/Sender.html>grace.log.test.centralized.Sender</a> 
<li><a href=../api/grace/log/test/centralized/Receiver.html>grace.log.test.centralized.Receiver</a> 
</ul>

Start the system like this:

<pre>
$ rmiregistry &
$ java grace.log.test.centralized.Server
$ java grace.log.test.centralized.Receiver
$ java grace.log.test.centralized.Sender
</pre>

<P>In this system, the server registers itself in the rmiregistry,
then the receiver looks up this server and adds itself as a <a
href=../api/grace/log/Handler.html>Handler</a> on the server.  This
makes it so the receiver will receive all events that are sent to the
server.  Finally, the sender looks up the server and installs a <a
href=../api/grace/log/ProxyHandler.html>ProxyHandler</a> to the server.
This means all events logged by the sender will be automatically sent
to the server.  So, an event logged by the sender is first sent by the
ProxyHandler to the server and then sent back to the receiver.

<P>The Server <a
href=../api/grace/log/Distributer.html>Distributer</a> registers
itself in the rmiregistry under the name
<code>log.distributer.<i>vmid</i></code>.  In fact any virtual machine
where Javlog is running will register itself under this pattern if the
<a href=properties/server.html>-Dlog.server=true</a> flag is set.  The
<i>vmid</i> is the id of the virtual machine and makes the entry in
the rmiregistry unique.  So, many servers in one virtual machine can
register themselves in the local registry.  This makes these virtual
machines available so that another remote process can send events to
or receive events from them.

<h2>Distributed</h2>

In this configuration, there are many logging virtual machines but no
server.  This is advantageous because it does not require the user to
start and maintain a separatly running central server process. This
system is comprised of a collection of virtual machines where each
logs separately, as in the standalone case.  Here, if one needs to
look at the log of a particular virtual machine, one needs to either
connect to that remote virtual machine with another process or save
all of the log events to a file.
