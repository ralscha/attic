<A NAME="abstract"></A>Abstract</H2>
Commercial software companies face many challenges in growing their business
in today's fast-moving and competitive industry environment. Recently many
people have proposed the use of an open-source development model as one
possible way to address those challenges. This document investigates the
business of commercial open-source software, including why a company might
adopt an open-source model, how open-source licensing works, what business
models might be usable for commercial open-source products, what special
considerations apply to commercial products released as open source, and
how various objections relating to open source might be answered. The target
audience is commercial software and hardware companies and individual software
developers considering some sort of open-source strategy or just curious
about how such a strategy might work.
<H2>
<A NAME="executive-summary"></A>Executive summary</H2>
If your company is in the software business either directly (as an independent
software vendor or ISV) or indirectly (for example, you produce software
as a key component of other goods or services) then it's likely that you
face several challenges in growing your business. Among them may be
<UL>
<LI>
to continue to create new products and bring in new incremental revenue;</LI>

<LI>
to improve new product quality at first release;</LI>

<LI>
to do a better job of sustaining engineering in supporting current and
older releases while still driving innovation in new releases;</LI>

<LI>
to more effectively recruit third-party developer and integrator support
for your company's products and platform; and (last but by no means least)</LI>

<LI>
to motivate and retain your current employees, and to recruit and energize
the next generation of your company's employees.</LI>
</UL>
I believe these challenges are interconnected, for two reasons. First,
most if not all of them are functions of constrained resources: few companies
have enough people, money, or time to do everything that needs doing, especially
when competing against larger companies with greater resources. Second,
I believe that your company has at least one possible strategy available
that may help address all these issues together -- turning some (or in
exceptional cases even all) of your software products into "open-source"
products, i.e., products for which you make the source code freely available
under liberal licensing terms and with no licensing fees, so that others
may take that software, make changes to it, and use or distribute the resulting
modified versions as they see fit.
<P>You've no doubt read about Netscape's recent release of the source code
for Netscape Communicator; you may also have heard about earlier open-source
projects like the Linux operating system and read papers like Eric Raymond's
<A HREF="http://sagan.earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">"The
Cathedral and the Bazaar"</A> that make a case for open-source development
within an extended developer community as a way to create better software.
In this paper I discuss why and how a commercial company might build a
business or extend an existing business through the creation and distribution
of open-source software -- in other words, how to "set up shop" in the
"bazaar."
<P>I first discuss particular problems and potential opportunities which
might lead you to consider doing something different from "business as
usual." I then explore the business proposition for open source software,
starting from the proposition that your company is in business to provide
customers with something of value and to receive money (or other things
of value) in return. Moving to open source for a product can potentially
provide better value to your customers, including in particular the ability
for your customers or third parties to improve that product through bug
fixes and product enhancements. In this way you can create better and more
reliable products that likely will more truly reflect your customers' requirements.
<P>However the real key to building a business on open-source software
is going beyond that to provide greater value to your customers than your
competitors can, and ultimately turning that increased value into increased
revenue and profits for your company. In the traditional software business
model your company provides all (or almost all) of the value to customers,
and you realize revenues and profits in return for that value through traditional
software license fees. In an open-source business model much of the value
provided to customers will not be provided solely by you, but rather by
other developers who are attracted to working on your open-source products
and who will thus help augment your resources as opposed to your competitors'.
These "outside" developers may be motivated by the prospect of working
with software that solves important problems for them and for others, by
the possibility of future gain providing related services and creating
related products, by the opportunity to increase their own personal knowledge,
or by the ego satisfaction of building an enhanced reputation among their
peers.
<P>Thus a significant part of your potential success will depend on the
work of others who will be working "for free," i.e., open source developers
who will contribute their work back to your company and to the developer
community at large without demanding or receiving any money or other tangible
payment in return. However open-source developers will not (and should
not) do this work unless you treat them fairly. This is in part a function
of your company's attitudes and actions towards developers working with
its products, but is also formalized in the company's choice of an open-source
license, specifying the terms and conditions under which the company's
open-source products can be used, modified, and redistributed.
<P>There have been several standard license agreements published for use
with open-source software. All of them share some <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">common
features</A>, most notably making software "free" to users both in terms
of being no-cost and in terms of minimizing restrictions on use and redistribution;
these features are explainable as necessary for developers to feel fairly
treated. If possible you should use one of the existing open-source licenses,
or modify one of those licenses to meet your needs; some licenses will
work better than others for particular business models. Possible license
choices include
<UL>
<LI>
no license at all (i.e., releasing software into the public domain)</LI>

<LI>
licenses like the BSD License that place relatively few constraints on
what a developer may do (including creating proprietary versions of open
source products)</LI>

<LI>
the GNU General Public License (GPL) and variants which attempt to constrain
developers from "hoarding" code, i.e., making changes to open-source products
and then not contributing those changes back to the developer community,
but rather attempting to keep them proprietary for commercial purposes
or other reasons</LI>

<LI>
the Artistic License, which modifies various of the more controversial
aspects of the GPL</LI>

<LI>
the Mozilla Public License (MozPL) and variants (including the Netscape
Public License or NPL) which go further than the BSD and similar licenses
in discouraging "software hoarding" but which still allow developers to
create proprietary add-ons if they wish</LI>
</UL>
Since you can't use traditional software licenses and license fees with
open-source software, you must find other ways of generating revenues and
profits based on the value you are providing to customers. Doing this successfully
requires selecting a suitable business model and executing it well; I discuss
several business models potentially usable by companies creating or leveraging
open-source software products (names and descriptions for the first four
models are courtesy of <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">OpenSource.Org</A>):
<UL>
<LI>
"Support Sellers," in which revenue comes from media distribution, branding,
training, consulting, custom development, and post-sales support instead
of traditional software licensing fees</LI>

<LI>
"Loss Leader," where a no-charge open-source product is used as a loss
leader for traditional commercial software</LI>

<LI>
"Widget Frosting," for companies that are in business primarily to sell
hardware but which use the open-source model for enabling software such
as driver and interface code</LI>

<LI>
"Accessorizing," for companies which distribute books, computer hardware
and other physical items associated with and supportive of open-source
software</LI>

<LI>
"Service Enabler," where open-source software is created and distributed
primarily to support access to revenue-generating on-line services</LI>

<LI>
"Brand Licensing," in which a company charges other companies for the right
to use its brand names and trademarks in creating derivative products</LI>

<LI>
"Sell It, Free It," where a company's software products start out their
product life cycle as traditional commercial products and then are continually
converted to open-source products when appropriate</LI>

<LI>
"Software Franchising," a combination of several of the preceding models
(in particular "Brand Licensing" and "Support Sellers") in which a company
authorizes others to use its brand names and trademarks in creating associated
organizations doing custom software development in particular geographic
areas or vertical markets, and supplies franchises with training and related
services in exchange for franchise fees of some sort</LI>
</UL>
I also discuss another class of business models, which I call "hybrid"
models, in which the constraints surrounding open source are relaxed in
one way or another. For example, a company might use both traditional licensing
and open-source-like licensing "side by side" for the same product, differentiating
between different users (e.g., for-profit organizations vs. not-for-profit
organizations vs. individuals) and/or between different types of use (e.g.,
intranet vs. extranet use, use on one platform vs. another, and so on);
alternately, a company might license source widely to any and all users,
and even allow "evaluation" licensing at no charge, but still charge "right-to-modify"
license fees and restrict re-distribution of modified versions in some
way. Although these business models are not true open-source models based
on a <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">strict definition</A>
of the term, they may be workable models for some companies in some cases.
<P>Beyond selecting an appropriate license and business model, what else
might your company have to do in order to implement an open-source strategy?
I discuss various issues your company will have to consider and address
when converting one or more products to open source, including
<UL>
<LI>
Code-sharing. For historical reasons your open source product may share
a common source code base with other of your products that will remain
proprietary. If so, you will need to make sure that open source development
can proceed without complicating your other internal development efforts;
this may require both special considerations in licensing and appropriate
modularization to enforce a clean separation between your open source and
your proprietary source.</LI>

<LI>
Third-party technology. Your product may include technology licensed from
third parties and present in your existing source code base. Such third-party
code will need to be treated specially in order to create a releasable
open-source product; typical options are to remove the code entirely, to
seek permission for inclusion of third-party code (perhaps under some special
arrangement), or to replace such code with open-source code providing equivalent
or similar functionality. The presence of third-party technology also can
influence your choice of open-source license.</LI>

<LI>
Code sanitization. You will need to do certain other things in order to
ensure your source code is ready for public distribution; these include
removal or revision of inappropriate language, comments intended for internal
viewing only, and so on.</LI>

<LI>
Export control. If your company is located in the US and your product contains
security and cryptographic code, in order to obtain export approval you
will almost certainly have to <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/crypto-faq.html">modify
your product for release as open source</A>, including removal of all cryptographic
code and security code that calls that code.</LI>

<LI>
Product development processes. Releasing source for a product will in almost
all cases significantly change the way you do product development; indeed,
without such changes you will not realize most of the benefits of an open-source
strategy. This problem is discussed in more detail elsewhere, but I discuss
a few key things you need to know, including in particular the advisability
of forming a dedicated team to be responsible for your open-source efforts,
the need to provide infrastructure for external developers (newsgroups,
source code repositories with revision control, special bug reporting systems,
etc.), and the desirability of having your own developers be "customers"
of that infrastructure, in principle no different than any other developers.</LI>
</UL>
Finally, I address some frequently-raised objections to converting commercial
software products to an open-source model:
<UL>
<LI>
"If you make a product open source, does that mean you're no longer committed
to it?" Even after you convert a product to open source, you can and should
continue to have ultimate responsibility for it in some sense; in particular,
you can not only exercise influence and oversight over the evolution of
the product, you can and should continue to release an "official" binary
version of the product yourself, packaged for easy installation by end
users and with full QA testing, product support, and branding.</LI>

<LI>
"But customers don't really want to have source code and can't take advantage
of it anyway. Why would they prefer an open-source product over a pre-packaged
binary product?" Some customers do indeed want source code and find it
of value. Other customers who prefer not to deal with source code can use
the pre-packaged "official" product binaries you'll continue to produce.
Both sets of customers benefit from the improved product quality and enhancements
resulting from open-source development.</LI>

<LI>
"Wouldn't this lead to fragmentation of the product into incompatible versions?"
This is one of the most common objections, but there is ample reason to
believe that this will not be an issue, both because of the particular
dynamics of open-source development as they have evolved over time, and
also because your company can exert a positive influence to minimize the
possibilities of this happening. In particular, the open-source developer
community has unwritten but historically-effective rules that assign control
of an open-source project, including the right to designate "official"
versions, to a single entity (an individual, an informal group, or a formal
organization); as the original developer of the product you are the natural
candidate to be that entity, assuming you do the necessary things to live
up to your assigned role.</LI>

<LI>
"What about the risk to customer from 'rogue' versions?" Again, this has
not proved to be a problem with open-source products, both because of public
review and also because there is typically a single place (i.e., the original
vendor) to get an "official" version that has undergone additional review
and testing.</LI>

<LI>
"What about providing technical support to customers with modified versions?"
If you wish you can choose not to support modified versions of your product
(i.e., versions built from a different code base than your "official" releases),
leaving such support to the general open-source community or to other companies
providing such support as a business. You can also contract out to external
developers to provide such support as part of your own support offerings.</LI>

<LI>
"Wouldn't customers be concerned with your open source code 'tainting'
theirs if they used it for their own projects?" To allay such concerns
you can use a non-tainting open-source license, such as a BSD-style license,
or a license like the Mozilla Public License that does not taint other
code that calls open-source code using a defined API.</LI>

<LI>
"What about embarrassing things that people might discover in our source
code?" Some "bad" things in your source code you definitely <I>want</I>
to be exposed, most notably bugs; open-source development increases the
chances that both major and minor bugs will be found and fixed. Other things
in your source code that might cause embarrassment, such as inappropriate
language in comments, can and should be removed during preparation of the
source for public release.</LI>

<LI>
"Wouldn't releasing your source code expose confidential plans and strategies
to competitors?" Moving to an open-source model implies to some degree
sharing your product strategies with external developers and letting them
influence those strategies; this implies sharing those strategies with
competitors as well. However at the same time this can result in greater
public support for your strategies (because the outside world is helping
you create those strategies), helping to counter those of your competitors.
Also, releasing source does not imply or require making all internal information
publicly available; in particular you can continue to keep a close hold
on confidential details of business plans and the like.</LI>

<LI>
"Wouldn't people just use our code and our expertise without our getting
anything in return?" This objection is similar to the original objections
to companies like Netscape allowing downloading of software over the Internet
at a time when vendors saw "software piracy" as a major cause of lost revenue.
The answer to the objection is also similar: that the benefits of a properly
executed open-source strategy can well outweigh the costs. To take but
one example, every bug discovered and fixed by a developer "out there"
directly saves you money otherwise required for QA and software maintenance
"in here;" it also increases the value of your software as a reliable product
and can indirectly lead to increased revenues for other products and services
associated with that software.</LI>

<LI>
"What about competitors who might try to 'hijack' an open-source product
for their own purposes?" Open-source licenses such as the GPL and MozPL
can be used to enforce public disclosure and sharing of source code modifications.
In the open-source world competitors must play by the same rules as everyone
else, and those rules have evolved to minimize the chances of one individual
or organization exercising undue advantage.</LI>
</UL>
When looked at closely there is nothing strange or magical about open-source
development from a business point of view; it should neither be shunned
as impractical nor embraced as a panacea. There is no one single model
you must follow, and it is not an "all or nothing" proposition. Open source
is simply a new (really, newly popularized) way of developing, distributing,
and licensing software, and for companies which understand the economic,
cultural, and political factors that go into implementing an effective
open-source strategy, the open-source model offers the promise of helping
your business better survive and thrive in an increasingly demanding environment.
<H2>
<A NAME="business-case"></A>Making the business case for open source</H2>
Open-source software and open-source development projects have existed
for many years now under the general term "free software". The word "free"
has traditionally led commercial software vendors to think "no revenue,"
and customers of those companies to think "no support;" thus free software
was assumed to be irrelevant to the commercial world, with free software
developers often cast as idealistic and naive. Similarly, the writings
of some free software advocates (in tone if not in substance) have seemed
to portray commercial software companies as interested only in short-term
profits at the expense of the long-term interests of users and the software
development community as a whole.
<P>Perceptions about free software (pro and con) have often been more absolute
than reality would warrant. To take but one example, even Richard Stallman,
often thought the free software advocate most hostile to commercial considerations,
did not argue in his <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">"GNU
Manifesto"</A> that software development should always be a unpaid or non-profit
activity; rather he proposed the abandonment of for-profit business models
based on treating software as intellectual property, arguing instead that
for-profit software development be done as a professional service. This
happens to be one of the open-source business models discussed below. Similarly
many commercial software companies have used software originating in the
free software community as the basis for commercial products, and in some
cases have contributed to the development of free software through donations
of money, hardware, or their employees' time.
<P>Events like the growing success of the Linux operating system (developed
under the free software model) and Netscape's recent release of Communicator
source code have focused more public attention on the potential importance
of free software to businesses both as users of software and as for-profit
producers of it; these events have also led to the recasting of "free"
software as "<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/history.html">open-source</A>"
software, a term that emphasizes more the importance of making source code
to software freely available, and also may (at least subliminally) remind
people that a company can choose to make source code freely available and
still serve its own business interests as a for-profit organization. (Note
however that open-source software is still "free" software in the sense
that no license fees are charged for use or redistribution of binaries
or source code, as well as in the sense that users are free to modify the
source and create and distribute derivative works.)
<P>Still, this strategy may seem counter-intuitive or even self-destructive;
it goes against years of tried and true commercial software practices.
However these are unusual times in the commercial software industry, and
may call for unusual measures. In considering a major change in strategy
like moving to open source, it may help to consider an historical analogy:
When Netscape first made the Navigator web browser available for unrestricted
download over the Internet, many saw this as flying in the face of conventional
wisdom for the commercial software business, and questioned how Netscape
could possibly make money "giving the software away." Now of course this
strategy is seen in retrospect as a successful innovation that was a key
factor (if not <I>the</I> key factor) in Netscape's rapid growth, and rare
is the software company today that does not emulate this strategy in one
way or another. It's possible that the current interest in open source
may signal another such industry-changing event.
<P>I've written this paper primarily for commercial software vendors considering
whether to take a product open-source; however it may also be of interest
to their customers considering why and how they might use such products,
and to open-source developers curious about the business side of open-source
products. My goal is to address some of the practical realities of the
business of open-source software, writing as someone who lobbied for an
open-source strategy within a major commercial software company (Netscape
Communications Corporation) and was a close observer of and sometime participant
in the implementation of that strategy.
<H3>
Why should you care?</H3>
Adopting an open-source business model can be a major decision for a commercial
company. Thus before doing anything else you should ask yourself a simple
question: "Do I really need or want to do this?" If your software business
is doing fine, and you have neither problems you need to solve nor potential
opportunities you want to take advantage of, then I really can't recommend
you consider an open-source strategy; adopting such a strategy incurs definite
costs in money, time, and effort, and I see no point in urging it on you
if there's no benefit to be gained.
<P>However it may be that you do in fact have either some present problems
or some future opportunities you are concerned about; here are some common
areas where commercial software companies might have "pain" or see "gain:"
<UL>
<LI>
Product line evolution. You want or need to continue to create new products
(or new add-ons to existing products) and bring in new incremental revenue.</LI>

<LI>
Product quality. You want or need to improve new product quality at first
release.</LI>

<LI>
Product maintenance. You want or need to do a better job of sustaining
engineering in supporting current and older releases while still driving
innovation in new releases.</LI>

<LI>
Third-party recruitment. You want or need to more effectively recruit third-party
developer and integrator support for your company's products and platform,
so that others can help increase the value of your product to customers,
and thus in effect help "sell" the product for you.</LI>

<LI>
Employee retention and recruitment. You want or need to better motivate
and retain your current employees, using something beyond standard incentives
like stock options and beer busts. At the same time you want to recruit
and energize the next generation of your company's employees, providing
them interesting and exciting opportunities they likely won't be able to
find elsewhere.</LI>
</UL>
I believe all of these areas can potentially benefit from an open-source
strategy of some type. As discussed below, properly implemented an open-source
strategy can allow you to bring more developer resources to bear on the
task of product development, QA, and maintenance; this can not only increase
product functionality and quality but can also increase the value of the
product as a platform for third-party developers and channel partners.
At the same time an open-source strategy can potentially motivate your
own developers by providing them more opportunity to have their skills
recognized and their efforts make a difference in the wider world.
<P>If these and other potential benefits are of interest to you, please
read on and see if and how this might apply to you. Because open source
is such a radical departure from traditional commercial software practice,
I think it will help to spend some time first going over the basic ideas
behind an open-source software business; to start, let's go back to square
one and consider the basic principles behind <I>any</I> successful business.
<H3>
<A NAME="why-be-in-business"></A>Why be in business?</H3>
As Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale likes to say, there is more to being in business
than simply making money; in particular, Barksdale often quotes Peter Drucker's
dictum that the purpose of any business is <I>to create customers and keep
them</I>. <I>Customers</I> are organizations or individuals who see value
in the products and services that you provide, and who pay you good money
in order to obtain them. You <I>create</I> customers by convincing people
that you can provide something of value to them and then persuading them
to give you money in exchange for that value. You <I>keep</I> customers
by providing them not just one-time but continuing value, sufficient that
they will continue to give you money in exchange for the value they continue
to receive.
<P>For customers, value is not necessarily associated with particular features
of a product. (In fact, products with the same features offered by two
different companies may have different value for customers in each case.)
More generally, a product has value for customers to the extent that <I>it
helps them solve problems</I>; the more problems it can help them solve
or the more important the problem it helps them solve, the more value the
product has. Customers may solve these problems with the help of the product's
actual features (as web browsers like NCSA Mosaic and Netscape Navigator
originally helped solve the problem of accessing the Internet without complicated
utilities) or they may solve their problems with the help of other product
attributes (as a company's brand name and reputation for quality might
help solve the problem of making a "safe" buying decision).
<P>To remain successful over time a company can attempt to add additional
value to its product line by adding new features to existing products,
adding new products, adding new ways to use the products (e.g., services
associated with the products), and so on. For your company to continue
to grow you need to find new ways to provide value to customers, and new
ways to convert that value into money.
<P>But your competitors also can add new features, new products, and new
ways to use them, and in many cases they have greater resources with which
to do this. If you want to be successful in a competitive market you can
attempt to do so by offering particular product value earlier than your
competitors, by matching or exceeding the value that your competitors'
resources create for their own products, and by creating value for your
products and services in ways that your competitors cannot easily duplicate.
<P>In a time of rapid innovation competing successfully means continually
having to pursue advantages in relative value deriving primarily from product
features (advantages which are often temporary), combined with more strategic
attempts to alter the competitive balance in ways with which your competitors
are less prepared to cope. Seen in this light a move to more of an open-source
business model is <I>not</I> simply a tactical move to solve a particular
business problem, but rather can be part of an overall strategy to <I>change
the rules</I> of competition in your market space and perhaps in the software
industry as a whole.
<H3>
<A NAME="crown-jewels"></A>Giving away the 'crown jewels'?</H3>
Let's assume for now that you agree with my comments above, and that you're
at least willing to consider that open source offers a possible way for
your company to better compete in the market. However I suspect that at
some point in your experience with the concept of open source you, someone
with whom you've been talking, or a news article you've read has raised
the question "Why would a software company want to give away its crown
jewels to the world?"
<P>The idea of source code as "crown jewels" is simply a commonly-used
metaphor, and metaphors can be powerful forces for good or ill depending
on the context. In this case the metaphor implies that a software company's
source code is a precious resource that must be protected at all costs
from anyone outside the company who would seek to obtain it or (mis)use
it. Thus most commercial software companies release their products' source
code only in very special situations, and do so only when accompanied with
an array of legal arrangements (including non-disclosure agreements and
very tightly-worded terms and conditions regarding redistribution) and
a large amount of money changing hands.
<P>But arguably possessing source code <I>in and of itself</I> is irrelevant.
Source code acquires true commercial value only if you can use it to create
products and/or services that you sell for money, and you can typically
do this successfully only in the context of a company with a known brand
name and a sustainable market position. (For example, even if I had the
source code to Windows it still wouldn't make me Bill Gates.) Similarly,
releasing source code for one of your products would <I>not</I> necessarily
mean that other companies could duplicate your successes or even adversely
affect your business. Those successes are typically a result of much more
than the product features implemented in your source code; other factors
might include the celebrity of and trust placed in your brand name, the
quality and reputation of your services, the effectiveness of your sales
and distribution channels, and so on. Those factors could still be very
much influenced by you, even in the absence of complete control over the
source code itself.
<H3>
<A NAME="value-of-source"></A>What is the value of source code?</H3>
Once you've accepted the possibility that releasing source code for one
or more of your products might be a component of your overall business
strategy, two questions then arise: How does distributing source code create
value for customers, and how can your company convert that value into revenue
and profits (i.e., money)?
<P>First note that by "source code" for a given product I mean the underlying
programming language statements (and related information, e.g., make files,
error message files, etc.) which can be read by humans, modified to make
changes and additions, and then used to build a functional version of the
product or another derivative product reusing some or all of the same source
code. For purposes of this discussion we assume that for a given product
you would distribute all relevant source code. (In actual practice this
may not be possible in all cases, as discussed below; for example, initially
you might have to distribute some components of a product in binary form
only, or not distribute certain components at all.)
<P>Much software has traditionally been distributed in source code form,
and there are several commonly-accepted ways in which having source code
for a product can directly increase the value of that product for a customer
by helping them solve any of a number of problems:
<UL>
<LI>
The customer can better protect their investment in a software product
in the event that the software vendor goes out of business or decides to
discontinue a product that is critical to the customer's operations. (Source
code escrow provisions in contracts provide similar protection, but typically
only for the case where a vendor goes out of business. Source code escrow
also does not provide the additional indirect benefits discussed below.)</LI>

<LI>
The customer can better understand how the software works in the event
that the vendor's documentation is incomplete or confusing.</LI>

<LI>
The customer can look for and correct potential security flaws in the product
that might otherwise adversely impact the customer's operations.</LI>

<LI>
The customer can fix bugs themselves if the vendor is unable or unwilling
to do so.</LI>

<LI>
The customer can subject the product to independent audit for proper Year
2000 support and other requirements and can correct any problems found.</LI>

<LI>
The customer can port the software to new operating systems and/or hardware
platforms not otherwise supported by the vendor.</LI>

<LI>
The customer can use the source code to create customized versions of the
original software product, extended and improved versions, or whole new
applications, thus avoiding the need to write those applications "from
scratch."</LI>
</UL>
Distributing source code for a product can also more indirectly increase
the product's value to a customer:
<UL>
<LI>
Writers and trainers not associated with the software vendor can create
more complete and correct documentation and training material, because
they do not have to rely often on the vendor's (sometimes incomplete) original
documentation. This makes learning about the product easier, so that customers
can more easily and cheaply train their end users and developers.</LI>

<LI>
Consultants and systems integrators can become more familiar with the technology
and techniques underlying the product, and can become more skilled in implementing
systems based on or incorporating it. This creates a wider base of people
able to implement complex applications using the product, and this in turn
means that customers can implement systems more cheaply (because there
is more competition among people possessing the minimum necessary expertise)
and/or can implement more functional systems for the same price (because
the most skilled implementors possess greater expertise than they might
otherwise).</LI>

<LI>
Third parties can find bugs and security flaws and create fixes for them;
the fixes can then be incorporated into the original product. This makes
the product more bug-free and secure than it might otherwise be, increasing
the product's value by helping customers lower software operational and
maintenance costs.</LI>

<LI>
Other software suppliers can reuse the source code (assuming that this
is permitted and even encouraged) to create modifications and add-ons to
the original product that provide features that the original product does
not provide. Customers can use these new products to implement more functional
systems than they might be otherwise, and this increases the overall value
of the original product considered as a platform on which to build.</LI>
</UL>
These ways to increase value are again quite familiar to anyone acquainted
with products such as the Linux operating system, the GNU C++ compiler,
or the Apache web server that are normally distributed with source code
(or for which source code is available separately). Together they help
to make open-source products <I>whole products</I>, in the sense used by
Geoffrey Moore (in <I><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0887307175/">Crossing
the Chasm</A></I> and <I><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0887307655/">Inside
the Tornado</A></I>) and others: products accompanied with all the additional
things necessary to ensure that the value experienced by the customer matches
the value promised by the vendor. These things include support, documentation,
training, third-party consulting and system integration, a thriving developer
community to use the product in innovative ways and create add-ons to the
product, a set of de jure or de facto standards upon which the vendor and
others can build, and so on.
<P>If you compete with larger companies, this is exactly where their greater
resources and experience serve them well; to compete successfully with
such companies as time goes on, you must not only create products that
are more functional than your competitors' in a generic sense, but must
also find ways to approach or match your competitors' whole product value,
ways that do not require your company to take on the entire burden of doing
so itself (given that your own resources do not equal those of your competitor).
<P>However, for as a commercial company it is not enough just to increase
the value of your products; you must also find sustainable ways to have
customers reflect that value back to you in the form of increased revenues
and profits. Before we consider possible ways to do that as part of an
open-source strategy, it's worth reviewing how commercial software companies
have traditionally approached this problem, and how this approach might
need to change in the open-source case.
<H2>
<A NAME="building-business-model"></A>Building a business model</H2>

<H3>
<A NAME="standard-model"></A>The standard software business model</H3>
Today the conventional way to get revenue in exchange for the value of
a proprietary software product is to sell the customer the <I>right to
use</I> the software product as opposed to selling them actual ownership
of the product (as they might own a physical object); even a customer buying
shrinkwrapped software sold in stores is technically buying a right-to-use
license rather than possession of the software itself. The legal basis
for right-to-use licensing is that the specific code and techniques underlying
the product are considered to be intellectual property of the developer
protected using legal constructs such as copyrights and patents; as the
owner of that intellectual property the developer can control its distribution
and use through legally-binding and enforceable contracts, and can charge
a fee to individuals and organizations wishing to enter into such contracts.
<P>Considered strictly from a business point of view right-to-use licensing
has several advantages, especially for the software vendor but in many
cases for the customer as well. First, right-to-use licenses can be tailored
to work in a wide variety of ways; for example, software can be licensed
per-user, per-machine, per-CPU (for multiprocessor systems), per-concurrent-user,
or for an entire organization or part of an organization (site licensing).
Different licensing schemes can also be employed based on the use to which
software will be put; for example, using software in support of a particular
end use may be done using a separate license from using that same software
in support of a different end use, even though the actual users of the
software may be the same in both cases. This allows the vendor to offer
preferential pricing schemes for certain customers or end uses as appropriate.
(For example, the vendor might allow no-charge unrestricted use by all
or some noncommercial customers, or might charge less for software used
only internally versus software used to provide services to external users.)
<P>Second, software license fees are independent of amounts charged to
the customer for services such as technical support, consulting, and systems
integration. For US software companies operating under SEC rules this means
that software license fees can normally be recognized as revenue immediately
at the time the associated product is shipped; by contrast, service fees
can be recognized as revenue only over time as the services are actually
delivered to customers. This can be an important consideration, especially
for small software startup companies that need to grow revenues quickly
in order to satisfy investors and fund growth in operations.
<P>Finally, since they are not directly tied to services provided by people,
software license fees can be independently negotiated between vendor and
customer based on the perceived value embodied in the software itself.
(For example, the perceived value might be roughly proportional to the
amount of money the software can save the customer. If that amount is large
then the perceived value of the software will be high.) At the same time
the incremental cost of selling another software license is relatively
low (since software can be easily reproduced). Thus assuming that the customer
and the overall market judge the perceived value of a software product
to be relatively high then (all other things being equal) a software company's
gross margin on software licenses will be higher than its gross margin
on services, and this will translate rather directly into increased profits
for the software company.
<P>Of course these characteristics of traditional right-to-use licenses
have their potential downsides as well. Licensing arrangements can be overly
complicated and difficult for both vendor and customer to administer. The
immediate recognition of revenue from software license fees can produce
undesired peaks and valleys in a software company's revenue stream, especially
when the number of customers is relatively small and the average revenue
per customer relatively large, so that the difference of even a day or
two in concluding a few deals may shift a fair amount of revenue into one
quarter from the next, or vice versa. And higher gross margins for software
licenses are susceptible to price pressure from competitors willing and
able to discount software heavily or even to give software away on its
own or by bundling it with other software.
<P>My purpose here is neither to argue for the superiority of the traditional
software business model nor to claim that it can and must be completely
abandoned. Rather I want to emphasize these important points:
<UL>
<LI>
For a company considering adopting an open-source strategy, open source
needs to be evaluated from a business point of view and not just as "a
good thing to do." That requires being clear on the advantages and disadvantages
of open source relative to the traditional model.</LI>

<LI>
How software is licensed has important implications for the software business;
this is no less true for open-source business models than it is for traditional
software business models.</LI>

<LI>
Any for-profit company must set prices for its products and services, even
when using an open-source business model. (Of course that price could be
zero for certain products and/or services.) All other things being equal
a software company will be more financially successful setting prices based
primarily on perceived value rather than based primarily on cost, in cases
where it can legitimately do so (and assuming of course that the perceived
value exceeds the cost). Thus it's worth looking at various open-source
business models to see where goods and/or services might justifiably be
priced using such "value-driven" pricing as opposed to "cost-driven" pricing.</LI>
</UL>
Why do I use the terms "legitimately" and "justifiably" in connection with
value-driven pricing? If the customer feels that a product has value to
warrant the price and if the seller is not coercing the buyer in any way,
then surely any price can be justified, no matter how high, and no pricing
scheme is morally "better" than another. Yes, but in the case of open-source
software there are other parties involved in the transaction, namely those
developers who contribute bug fixes, minor enhancements, and (in some cases)
major additions in functionality, usually without any direct monetary compensation.
Although such developers freely choose whether to do this or not, both
pragmatic considerations and simple fairness dictate that you take their
opinions and interests into consideration when determining your desired
business model and how to price your products and services; I discuss this
in more detail below.
<H3>
<A NAME="why-work-for-free"></A>"Why would outside developers work on open-source
products 'for free'?"</H3>
I've discussed above how by distributing source code your company could
be able to take advantage of the talents of "outside" software developers.
But why would those developers want to work with your source code, especially
those developers who are doing it noncommercially and thus in a sense are
working "for free?"
<P>First, developers are in large part attracted to working on software
that holds the promise of helping them solve problems they themselves consider
significant. If you create software that addresses important problems,
even if the problems are important only to a subset of the overall developer
community, then it is a reasonably safe bet that at least some other developers
will find this software promising themselves and worthy of working with,
especially if they have access to the underlying source code. (As Eric
Raymond notes in the "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," your software need
not completely solve a problem, it need only offer a "plausible promise"
that it could do so as it is evolved.)
<P>Once attracted to working with your source code, what would keep developers
interested in doing so? The answers will vary depending on whether the
developers are doing commercial or noncommercial development. Commercial
developers will obviously be interested in some way to profit financially
from their work. Working with your source code they will likely have a
variety of possible approaches open to them:
<UL>
<LI>
They could specialize in customizing your software for particular customers
or vertical markets.</LI>

<LI>
They could provide fee-based product and/or developer support for customers.</LI>

<LI>
They could potentially create and sell add-on products, either independently
or as one of your channel partners. (Selling products themselves as opposed
to support for such products assumes that the license you use permits proprietary
add-ons; see below.)</LI>

<LI>
They could license derivative works and related technology back to you
(where the open-source license permits this).</LI>

<LI>
They could be hired by you, either as contractors or as employees.</LI>

<LI>
They could found companies that end up being acquired by your company or
others.</LI>
</UL>
About the only thing commercial developers could <I>not</I> do with your
source code is found new software businesses "from scratch" totally unencumbered
by source code licensing restrictions.
<P>For noncommercial developers the rewards would be different. They would
likely be motivated more by the ego reward of seeing their software used
by other people and praised by other developers. They may also be motivated
by the ideals of code sharing and general openness found in the open-source
developer community. If starting with your source allows them to build
more interesting software and if they can distribute that software freely
(thus spreading their reputation and/or upholding open-source ideals),
then it is likely that some of them would be enthusiastic about working
with your code.
<P>Assuming that developers have sufficient positive incentive to work
with your source code, you then also have to be concerned with removing
obstacles to their participation. This goes back to my comment above about
treating open-source developers fairly; licensing in particular is a key
area where considerations of fairness are important.
<H3>
<A NAME="basic-licensing-principles"></A>Basic principles of open-source
licensing</H3>
Historically open-source software has been "free software" in the sense
that no right-to-use license fee or right-to-redistribute license fee is
charged users for the software, whether in source or binary form. Note
that this does <I>not</I> mean that open-source products do not have software
licenses associated with them; in fact they almost always do. The <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">Open
Source Definition</A> (written by Bruce Perens and originally published
as the <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines">Debian
Free Software Guidelines</A>) is an abstraction from various free software
licenses in common use; it explicitly states that open-source software
licenses "may not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software"
and "may not require a royalty or other fee for such sale."
<P>This has the effect of setting the effective license price at zero,
since once a (binary or source) copy of the software is given to any user
then that user may turn around and redistribute the software to others
without charging them a license fee and without owing any license fee to
the originator of the software. The Open Source Definition also contains
a number of other provisions intended to prevent vendors from weakening
or evading this basic guarantee, including the provision that all users
and all types of end use be treated equally (so that, for example, businesses
cannot be charged a license fee while noncommercial use is exempted).
<P>Why should this be? Part of the reason lies in the origins of free software
as a concept; charging for software licenses was (and is) seen by many
as antithetical to the interests of users (who would be better off if provided
free and unrestricted use of software) and to society as a whole. For example,
in the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">GNU Manifesto</A>
Richard Stallman claimed that "[a]rrangements to make people pay for using
a program, including licensing of copies, always incur a tremendous cost
to society through the cumbersome mechanisms necessary to figure out how
much (that is, which programs) a person must pay for" and that
<BLOCKQUOTE>Extracting money from users of a program by restricting their
use of it is destructive because the restrictions reduce the amount and
the ways that the program can be used. This reduces the amount of wealth
that humanity derives from the program.</BLOCKQUOTE>
In this view open-source licenses are designed the way they are for essentially
utilitarian reasons, in order to promote the use, distribution, and creation
of useful software.
<P>However the provisions of the Open Source Definition and of open-source
licenses can also be seen not just as guarantees to users in general but
also as guarantees to software developers in particular, that they will
be treated fairly and given equal opportunity to succeed or fail based
on their merits. The underlying problem here is that the original developers
of the software are always privileged in a fundamental sense: under existing
legal environments they "own" the original code (in the sense of holding
copyright to it), they have the power to set license terms for its use
and redistribution (as a consequence of copyright), and given that they
know most about the software they will likely have the leading role in
its continued development (at least initially). This is obviously true
in the case of a commercial company converting a proprietary product to
open source; it is also true in the case of a noncommercial developer who
creates the initial version of an open-source program. (In his paper <A HREF="http://sagan.earthlink.net/~esr/writings/homesteading/">Homesteading
the Noosphere</A> Eric Raymond argues that for all open-source software
there will always be one person or organization that has "the exclusive
right...to <I>re-distribute modified versions</I>" [emphasis in the original],
and thus has a privileged position with respect to it; Raymond sees this
right as being a kind of common-law property right.)
<P>Consider the rest of the (actual or potential) developer community who
are not thus privileged and who are expected to contribute their labor
to the improvement of the open-source product, usually for no direct compensation.
Why should they participate in what threatens to be an unfair exchange,
unless the gap between privileged and non-privileged developers is minimized?
One way to minimize the gap is to eliminate license fees; this prevents
the privileged developer(s) from making a direct monetary profit from the
unpaid labor of other developers. A second way to minimize the gap is to
treat all developers equally in the context of the open-source licensing
terms, with no developer having special privileges or advantages <I>as
a direct consequence of the license</I>. This helps ensure that in theory
all developers have equal opportunity to achieve success, subject only
to the skill and resources they can bring to the task, and that neither
you nor anyone else can leverage a privileged position to obtain unjust
advantage over other developers.
<H3>
<A NAME="open-source-licenses"></A>Open source licenses</H3>
Over the years several licenses have been written for use with open-source
software, so that companies can select an appropriate license to match
their particular situations. If you wish you can also write a new license
(as Netscape did), either by creating it from scratch or by modifying an
existing license; however note that this is not as simple to do as it might
appear, and if you are contemplating doing this I strongly recommend that
you research the various open-source licenses in use today and acquaint
yourself as much as possible with the long history of public discussions
as to their respective merits.
<H4>
Public domain software</H4>
The first possible choice for an open source license is simply using no
license at all; this is the case for software that is released into the
public domain. Although the term "public-domain software" is often used
loosely to refer to open-source or free software in general, public-domain
software is strictly speaking software which has no copyright (e.g., the
copyright has expired, or the copyright holder has explicitly waived copyright);
since there is no copyright there is no "owner" of the software to grant
licenses, and hence anyone may use the software in any way without any
restrictions.
<P>Putting software into the public domain grants the maximum freedom possible
to end users and developers. However at the same time it opens the possibility
that one or more developers may take the software and use it as a base
to create proprietary programs; if those programs become dominant in the
market then from a practical point of view the software is no longer open-source,
even if one form of it remains available in the public domain. (In fact,
users may not even be aware that the proprietary products use public-domain
code.)
<P>Because of this potential problem most open-source advocates recommend
not making software public-domain; even developers who do not believe in
the concept of "intellectual property" still advocate using the mechanism
of copyright, if only to be able to use a formal open-source license to
promote certain beliefs and practices. (See the GNU General Public License
for the best example of this.)
<H4>
BSD License and BSD-style licenses</H4>
The <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/bsd-license.html">BSD License</A>
was originally used for the Unix distributions released by the University
of California at Berkeley. ("BSD" stands for "Berkeley Software Distribution.")
Since then the BSD License or licenses adapted from or similar to it (including
the original <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/mit-license.html">MIT and
X Consortium License</A>) have been used for several other open-source
projects, including <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>, <A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</A>,
and <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A> (Unix-based operating
systems), <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> (a web server), <A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~dirsvcs/ldap/doc/guides/slapd/">SLAPD</A>
(an LDAP-based directory service), <A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</A>
(an implementation of the X Window System), and <A HREF="http://www.fish.com/satan/">SATAN</A>
(a network security analysis tool), to mention only a few.
<P>The BSD License has the following main features:
<UL>
<LI>
an explicit grant of the right to unlimited use in source or binary form</LI>

<LI>
a requirement that the developers' copyright notices (and related material)
be retained</LI>

<LI>
a requirement that the developers be credited in "advertising material"</LI>

<LI>
legal boilerplate to limit the developers' liability</LI>
</UL>
Some licenses derived from the BSD License (like the original X Consortium
License) omit the advertising requirement (which <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">some
have criticized</A>); others add a provision requiring that the software
be provided "at cost."
<P>As noted above, the original BSD License was developed in order to release
non-commercial software developed as a byproduct of university research,
and its legal provisions reflect this heritage: they affirm the academic
tradition of giving proper credit to researchers (i.e., the developers)
and safeguard the basic legal interests of the university (i.e., the organization
employing the developers), but otherwise impose no real restrictions on
use of the software. From the point of view of a commercial software company
BSD-style licenses contain the minimum terms and conditions that an open-source
license would need to have in order to be an effective license at all;
from the point of view of open-source developers BSD-style licenses allow
the maximum freedom in using the source to create derivative works. This
includes the freedom to take open-source software under a BSD-style license
and use it to create a proprietary product for which source code is not
made available. As a result many open-source advocates recommend not using
BSD-style licenses, preferring licenses that require (to a greater or lesser
degree) that derivative works of open-source software also be made available
as open source.
<H4>
GNU General Public License</H4>
The <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</A>
(GNU GPL or plain GPL) was created by Richard Stallman and the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/fsf/fsf.html">Free
Software Foundation</A>. The GPL in many ways occupies a place at the opposite
end of the spectrum from BSD-style licenses: Where BSD-style licenses permit
essentially unlimited commercial use of open-source software and essentially
unrestricted creation of proprietary derivative works, the GPL is explicitly
designed to prevent open-source software from being used to create proprietary
derivative works. It does this through <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">"copyleft"</A>
provisions in the GPL that require
<UL>
<LI>
that programs licensed under the GPL must be distributed without a license
fee and with source code made available; and</LI>

<LI>
that derivative works of a program licensed under the GPL must also be
licensed under the GPL.</LI>
</UL>
The GPL has a quite broad definition of what constitutes a derivative work
of a GPL-ed program: "any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof".
Besides modified versions of GPL-ed programs, this clearly includes programs
that incorporate code fragments from a GPL-ed program or whose executables
include statically linked GPL-ed libraries. It does not matter what license
the source code of the new program was originally licensed under; the GPL
explicitly states that
<BLOCKQUOTE>[W]hen you distribute the same sections [i.e., code not under
the GPL] as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program [i.e.,
a work under the GPL], the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License [i.e., the GPL], whose permissions for other licensees
extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless
of who wrote it. [notes added]</BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus if you use GPL-ed code in a proprietary program containing your own
source code, you must make your source code available under the same terms
as the original GPL-ed code. (This property of GPL-ed code has led many
to compare it to a virus subverting the proprietary "host" program to create
more GPL-ed code.)
<P>Two interesting cases are where a proprietary program dynamically links
to GPL-ed code or a GPL-ed program dynamically links to proprietary code.
The latter case arises when a GPL-ed program uses existing system facilities
such as C run-time libraries or GUI toolkit libraries; the GPL contains
a special provision (in paragraph 3) exempting proprietary libraries from
source code disclosure provisions if they are "normally distributed (in
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
and so on) of the operating system."
<P>As to the former case, <A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=353128930">Richard
Stallman has claimed</A> that if a developer uses GPL-ed code to write
code designed to be dynamically linked to from a proprietary program (for
example, a GPL-ed plug-in module for a proprietary image processing program)
then that developer is violating the GPL; <A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=353981405">Stallman
later clarified this</A> to add that if the developer were writing the
GPL-ed code "from scratch" then they could grant special permission to
use the code in this way, or if using GPL-ed code from other developers
could ask those developers to grant such an exemption. This does not however
change the intent of the GPL: Stallman still claims that "a GPL-covered
plug-in that is designed to be combined with a non-free master program
is a form of combined work, and a violation of the GPL." (Of course in
the end this is simply Stallman's personal opinion, albeit an opinion that
carries considerable weight among many free software developers; what constitutes
a "combined work" or "derived work" in general is ultimately a question
for the courts, and if a court ever decides a case involving the GPL they
may or may not agree with Stallman on this point.)
<P>The fact that GPL-ed code can "taint" initially non-GPL-ed programs
means that in effect you can use GPL-ed source code only to create other
GPL-ed programs. This is a desirable feature if (like the Free Software
Foundation) you wish to encourage the spread of the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/">GNU
philosophy</A>. It is also somewhat desirable (or at least tolerable) if
you are creating an open-source product from scratch or if you wish to
leverage others' GPL-ed code for your product, because the GPL is widely
used and accepted in the free software developer community and there is
a large base of existing GPL-ed code. However it creates a problem (and
deliberately so) for commercial software vendors who wish to build their
own proprietary products using GPL-ed code in some way; it also causes
many commercial organizations to shy away from using GPL-ed software.
<P>In particular, if you are considering converting a proprietary software
product into an open-source product, and if your product includes third-party
technology or shares source code with other products of yours, then the
GPL would almost certainly not be a good open-source license for you to
use because it would be difficult to impossible to put only part of your
code under the GPL and still use that code in products in conjunction with
third-party code or your own remaining proprietary code. (You could evade
this issue initially by releasing your code under both the GPL and another
less-restrictive open-source license and then using the less restrictive
license when combining your open-source code with other code. However once
others began to add their own GPL-ed code to yours then you could no longer
use that new code under the less-restrictive license, unless you obtained
permission to do so from each and every contributor; that could pose insurmountable
problems if the contributed code were in turn based on previously GPL-ed
code from others, and so on.)
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU Library General
Public License</A> (GNU LGPL or plain LGPL) attempts to better address
the case of open-source products that are libraries intended to be used
with other programs, as opposed to programs in their own right; a program
that calls routines in a LGPL-ed library is not considered a derived work
for licensing purposes in exactly the same sense that it would be if the
library were licensed under the GPL. However other derived works of the
LPGL-ed library fall under LGPL terms, exactly as they would if the GPL
were used instead. The LGPL may or may not be a good license for you to
use for an open-source product, again depending on whether the product
is being converted from an existing proprietary product and how third-party
and still-proprietary code is used in that product.

Community License</A>). The Artistic License is perhaps best thought of
an attempt to create an open-source license that eliminates or mitigates
the more controversial aspects of the GPL. In particular the Artistic License
differs from the GPL in the following ways (among others):
<UL>
<LI>
The Artistic License encourages users to make modifications freely and
publicly available, but allows exemptions from such a requirement in the
cases where the derived works are used only within an organization and
are not publicly distributed, or where the derived works are not represented
as being the original work, i.e., the derived work's executables have different
names and differences from the original work are documented. The GPL has
no such exemptions.</LI>

<LI>
The Artistic License allows the original work or derived works to be embedded
"invisibly" in a proprietary program, i.e., where the proprietary program
does not expose direct interfaces to the functionality of the original
or derived work. Under the GPL the proprietary program would be considered
a derived work also subject to the GPL.</LI>

<LI>
The Artistic License explicitly declares that input and output data submitted
to or produced by the original work (or derived works) does not fall under
the terms of the license. This is presumably intended to address a feature
of the GPL whereby output from such GPL-ed works as GNU flex (a program
to generate lexical analyzer code) was considered to fall under the GPL,
since such output contained program fragments embedded as data in the original
GPL-ed source code and was thus considered a derived work under the GPL.</LI>
</UL>
Unfortunately the Artistic License is not as general-purpose as it might
be; in particular, some of its provisions (e.g., Sections 5 and 7) seem
to assume that the product being licensed is a language interpreter (like
Perl) or similar program. However the Artistic License (or a variant thereof)
is a possible candidate license for anyone looking for an open-source license
more encouraging of code sharing than BSD-style licenses but less restrictive
than the GPL or GPL-like licenses.
<H4>
Mozilla Public License</H4>
The <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/MPL-1.0.html">Mozilla Public License</A>
(MozPL or MPL) and the related <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/NPL-1.0.html">Netscape
Public License</A> (NPL) were created by Netscape as part of the project
to release Netscape Communicator source code. Where the BSD License was
created by a university and the GPL and Artistic License were created by
free software developers (albeit with somewhat different philosophies),
the MozPL is notable as an open-source license created by a commercial
software company. As one of the newest open-source licenses the MozPL was
influenced by and to some extent incorporates features from a number of
older licenses, including the GPL and LGPL; however the MozPL is a distinctive
license in its own right and has a number of interesting and even innovative
features not found in other open-source licenses.
<P>First, the MozPL contains a general and relatively rigorous definition
of when and how derived works fall under the MozPL license provisions (or
are "Covered Code," using the terminology of the license). For MozPL-ed
source code considered as a set of source files, modifications of the original
source files are considered to also fall under the MozPL, as are new source
files incorporating extracts from the original source files. Such modified
or new files are required to be licensed under the same terms as the original
files, and in particular must be made freely and publicly available in
source form. In this way the MozPL is similar to the GPL in mandating sharing
of code modifications and seeking to prevent open-source code from being
converted to proprietary code.
<P>However unlike the GPL the MozPL explicitly permits MozPL-ed code to
be combined with separate proprietary code to create a proprietary program
(a "Larger Work" in MozPL terminology) which does <I>not</I> fall under
MozPL terms; such a program may be licensed for a fee and its (proprietary)
source code need not be made publicly available. As implied above, the
separation between the open-source code and the proprietary code is made
at the source file boundaries; a given source file is either under the
MozPL or under a different license, which may be a proprietary or an open-source
license. (The other license must be compatible with the MozPL in the sense
that its provisions may not conflict with those of the MozPL; among other
things this rules out combining MozPL-ed and GPL-ed code, since the presence
of the GPL-ed code would result in the application of GPL terms to the
combined code. However the LGPL allows enough flexibility so that LGPL-ed
code may be combined with MozPL-ed code.)
<P>Thus an open-source product initially released under the MozPL may be
extended with proprietary code to create new proprietary products, as long
as the proprietary code is separate (i.e., in separate files) and interacts
with the open-source code using a defined API. (This feature of the MozPL
is to some extent reminiscent of the LGPL, although the corresponding LGPL
terms are more restrictive.) If the enabling code for the API is not already
in the open-source product then changes to the open-source product to create
the API fall under the MozPL (because they would be modifications to the
original MozPL-ed source files) and must be made freely and publicly available
by the developer creating the API (which in this case would be the developer
creating the proprietary product). This encourages open competition among
both commercial and non-commercial developers by allowing others to create
alternatives (whether open-source or proprietary) to any proprietary products
based on MozPL-ed code.
<P>The NPL is a variant of the MozPL designed specifically for use with
the released Netscape Communicator source code. (In practice the NPL was
drafted first and the MozPL then generalized from it.) The NPL exists because
prior to being released as open source Netscape Communicator already existed
as a proprietary commercial product that shared source code with other
proprietary products (including Netscape's SuiteSpot servers) and for which
source code had been licensed to third parties under existing contracts
still in force; the MozPL by itself would not be sufficient to address
the consequent legal complications. The NPL duplicates all MozPL provisions
and in addition reserves to Netscape two rights not granted to other developers:
the right to use NPL-ed code in other products (like the SuiteSpot servers)
without having those products fall under the NPL, and the right to relicense
NPL-ed source code to third parties on terms other than those in the NPL.
The former right is limited in time (to two years), since the shared code
in question can be reorganized over time to separate NPL-ed code and proprietary
code into different files and libraries. The latter right is not limited
in time, since the third-party contracts in question may exist in perpetuity.
<P>In my (admittedly biased) opinion the MozPL (or a MozPL variant, such
as an NPL-like license, if necessary) deserves serious consideration as
the license of choice for any commercial company looking at creating an
open-source product from scratch, converting a proprietary product to open
source, or making open-source extensions or additions to proprietary products;
it was designed specifically for the requirements of a commercial software
company doing both proprietary and open-source development and was created
by lawyers and others intimately familiar with commercial software practices.
(Thus, for example, the MozPL incorporates legal language typically required
in standard commercial software contracts relating to limitations of liability,
responsibility for intellectual property claims, arbitration of disputes,
and so on.) The major case where the MozPL is not appropriate is where
you are building a business based on existing open-source software already
under the GPL or a GPL-like license.
<P>Even if you decide not to use the MozPL it is still worth consulting
Netscape's <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/FAQ.html">material</A> about
the MozPL and NPL and the <A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.license">public
discussions</A> through which Netscape received advice on and criticisms
of the draft licenses; these are especially valuable as background information
if you decide to create your own open-source license.
<H3>
<A NAME="how-to-make-money"></A>How to make money with open source?</H3>
Now back to the question at hand: How can a software company convert a
product to open source and have the increased value provided to customers
lead to increased revenue and profits for the company; in simpler terms,
how is it possible to make money with an open-source product?
<P>As discussed above, you will <I>not</I> make money through traditional
software licensing fees. Thus open-source software is a real-life example
of a case considered by many industry visionaries, namely intellectual
property that is "free" in the sense that anyone can copy it and use it
at no charge. (Alternatively, one could consider open-source software as
not constituting intellectual property at all, a view held by some open-source
advocates; see also the discussion on licensing above.) For example, Esther
Dyson (in <I><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0767900111/">Release
2.0</A></I> and elsewhere) has assumed that intellectual property considered
as "content" will be free or near-free in the future, and has proposed
the use of other business models for making money off intellectual property,
based generally on either providing services tied to the intellectual property
(e.g., as in consulting) or on using the intellectual property to attract
people's attention and then realizing money from that (e.g., as in advertising).
<H3>
<A NAME="open-source-business-models"></A>Open-source business models</H3>
More specifically, there are a number of business models that have been
attempted with open-source source, and a number of others that are possible
in theory and may be workable in practice. As discussed above, all of the
models assume the absence of traditional software licensing fees. I discuss
these models in more detail below, including:
<UL>
<LI>
which vendors (if any) are using this model</LI>

<LI>
what general types of open-source license might be appropriate for the
model</LI>

<LI>
what opportunities exist for vendors to differentiate themselves</LI>

<LI>
what opportunities exist to set prices based on perceived value rather
than actual cost</LI>
</UL>
(Note: The names and basic definitions for the first four models below
are from the <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">OpenSource.Org</A> web
site.)
<H4>
<A NAME="support-sellers"></A>Support Sellers</H4>
In the "Support Sellers" model software-related revenue comes from media
distribution, branding, training, consulting, custom development, and post-sales
support instead of from traditional software licensing fees. This is the
original free software business model advocated by Richard Stallman in
the GNU Manifesto and first implemented by <A HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/">Cygnus
Solutions</A>, a for-profit company formed to provide support services
for GNU tools (most notably the GNU compilers). It is the most common model
today for companies involved with open source and in the Linux market is
used by several vendors, of which <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red
Hat Software</A> and <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera Software</A>
are perhaps best known. For historical reasons all these companies use
the GNU General Public License (GPL), but most if not all open-source licenses
would work for this model.
<P>Revenue is generated in this model by selling two broad categories of
items: physical goods, e.g., media and hard-copy documentation, and/or
services, e.g., technical support. Vendors can differentiate themselves
by providing more complete and easier-to-use software distributions, in
essence simplifying and improving the user's experience with the open-source
software in question; they can also differentiate themselves by the quality
and pricing of their service offerings.
<P>In this model there is only limited ability to use value-driven pricing;
more typically the pricing is determined primarily by the cost to provide
goods and services, as there is price competition with other vendors offering
comparable goods and services and definite limits to what users are willing
to pay for them. However if a vendor's reputation is good then that can
be used to justify higher prices than for a "commodity" offering.
<H4>
<A NAME="loss-leader"></A>Loss Leader</H4>
In the "Loss Leader" model a no-charge open-source product is used as a
loss leader for traditional commercial software; the open-source product
generates little or no revenue, but providing the product makes it more
likely that customers will buy other products that are sold using the traditional
software business model. To some extent this is the model now being used
by Netscape with the Netscape Communicator product (but see also the discussion
of the "Service Enabler" business model below); it will also be used by
<A HREF="http://www.sendmail.com/">Sendmail,
Inc.</A>, which plans to release a <A HREF="http://www.sendmail.com/8_9pro.html">commercial
product</A> based on the <A HREF="http://www.sendmail.com/8_9free.html">open-source
version</A> of the popular <A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/">sendmail</A>
mail system..
<P>If the open-source product shares any source code with the company's
proprietary products (for example, they use common libraries) then the
open-source license chosen must allow distribution of such source code
for the open-source product while allowing the same source code to be used
in proprietary products distributed using standard licenses. The company
should therefore avoid the use of the GPL or other licenses that aggressively
"taint" products incorporating code under the license; a BSD-style license
would work fine, and the Mozilla Public License or variants thereof might
be appropriate if the common source code is accessed via a set of defined
APIs.
<P>Generation of revenue (if any) from the open source product could be
done as in the "Support Sellers" model, i.e., by selling media and services.
However typically the bulk of revenue generated would be through sales
of other software products; having the open-source product could increase
sales of such traditional products in various ways:
<UL>
<LI>
by helping build the overall vendor brand and reputation</LI>

<LI>
by making the traditional products more functional and useful (in essence
adding value to them)</LI>

<LI>
by increasing the overall base of developers and users familiar with and
loyal to the vendor's total product line</LI>
</UL>
Vendors have ample scope to differentiate themselves based on the products
in the traditional product line, and can also employ value-driven pricing
where appropriate with such products.
<H4>
<A NAME="widget-frosting"></A>Widget Frosting</H4>
The "Widget Frosting" business model is intended for companies that are
in business primarily to sell hardware ("widgets") but which use the open-source
model for enabling software such as driver and interface code ("frosting")
distributed at no charge along with the hardware. The hardware could be
anything from a individual chipset to a controller board to a peripheral
device to a complete computer system. The enabling software could be driver
code (e.g., for a graphics board or peripheral), compilers and linkers
(e.g., for microprocessors and related chips), or complete applications
or operating systems (e.g., for a workstation or network computer). Companies
could use any of a number of open-source licenses.
<P><A HREF="http://www.corel.com/">Corel</A> is using this model for the
<A HREF="http://www.corelcomputer.com/products/linux_products.htm">Netwinder</A>
product line to be offered by its <A HREF="http://www.corelcomputer.com/">Corel
Computer</A> subsidiary; Netwinder is essentially a network computer using
Linux as its operating system. Corel Computer is <A HREF="http://www.corelcomputer.com/products/announcement.htm">porting
Linux to Netwinder</A> and will release all Netwinder driver code as open
source under the GPL; it will also release a set of Netwinder development
tools based on open-source applications. Another example of companies using
this model to some degree is <A HREF="http://www.varesearch.com/">VA Research</A>
and other companies which sell PCs designed and preconfigured to run Linux;
unlike Corel VA Research and its competitors are selling standard PC hardware,
but are still using Linux to maximize the utility of their systems (e.g.,
as network servers or high-end workstations).
<P>In the "Widget Frosting" model most if not all revenue would be generated
through sales of the hardware itself. Using open source for the enabling
software could increase hardware sales as in the "Loss Leader" scenario,
e.g., by increasing the base of developers familiar with the hardware and
able to make it perform to full capacity, thus making the hardware more
functional, reliable, and useful to its end users.
<P>In this model vendors can differentiate themselves based on the attributes
of the underlying hardware, e.g., functionality, performance, reliability,
flexibility, and cost; the function of the open-source software is to enable
the hardware to fulfill its full potential with regard to these qualities.
Since the vendor is selling physical goods for which competitive products
exist in most cases, the pricing is typically much more cost-driven than
value-driven.
<H4>
<A NAME="accessorizing"></A>Accessorizing</H4>
The "Accessorizing" business model is for companies which distribute books
and other physical items (as opposed to software and services) associated
with and supportive of open source software. Here the company does not
typically participate in open-source development per se, but rather for
the most part piggybacks on open-source software developed and maintained
by others. A good example of a company pursuing this model is <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly
&amp; Associates</A>, which publishes books documenting and explaining
various open software products (including Linux, Perl, GNU Emacs, etc.).
The only license feature required for this model is the ability to bundle
free software with the item being sold (where this makes sense); by definition
this is permitted by any true open-source license.
<P>Vendors can differentiate themselves based on the quality of the goods
themselves, and can also build some brand loyalty among people who use
and like open-source software and who are appreciative of vendors that
support it in some way. Since what is being sold here is a physical item
as opposed to intellectual property of some sort, pricing will tend to
be cost-driven rather than value-driven for the most part, although in
some cases brand reputation can justify somewhat higher prices than otherwise
possible.
<H4>
<A NAME="service-enabler"></A>Service Enabler</H4>
In the "Service Enabler" business model a company creates and distributes
open-source software primarily to support access to revenue-generating
on-line services. (The services may generate revenue, e.g., through subscription
fees or advertising.) To a certain extent Netscape can be seen as pursuing
this model in addition to the "Loss Leader" model, given that Netscape
Communicator can be used as a front-end to access Netscape's Netcenter
services (from which Netscape derives revenue from advertising and related
sources). Another example would be a company providing a fee-based on-line
game service which created special-purpose software to access the service
and then distributed the software as open source so that users could not
only download the software at no charge but could also modify the software,
e.g., to customize it for their use or to support special input or output
devices.
<P>For this model a company would likely use an open-source license that
minimized the possibility that its open source software could be turned
directly into proprietary software by competitors; examples of such licenses
include the GPL and the Mozilla Public License.
<P>Vendors can differentiate themselves based on the attributes of the
services themselves; some of these attributes are a function of the open-source
software serving as the front end, but as much or more would be a function
of the back-end systems. Those back-end systems could be based on proprietary
software or on a combination of open-source and proprietary software; in
either case, by creating unique and useful services which could not be
easily duplicated by competitors a company could justify pricing the service
more commensurate with the value experienced by the user. (For example,
an on-line gaming service could price itself based on the entertainment
value it provides to users relative to alternatives like traditional video
games, movies, and cable TV.)
<P>The following business models are more theoretical, in the sense that
no companies appear to be actively using them today. However they appear
to be at least theoretically feasible, and it may be that in the future
one or more companies will be able to implement them successfully.
<H4>
<A NAME="sell-it-free-it"></A>Sell It, Free It</H4>
The "Sell It, Free It" model is essentially the "Loss Leader" model repeated
and extended through time. In this model a company would deliberately structure
its development and licensing practices so as to release software products
first as traditional commercial products and then convert them to open-source
products when they reach an appropriate point in their life cycle where
the benefits of developing them in an open-source environment outweigh
the direct software license revenue they produce. The newly freed open-source
products would still add value to the remaining proprietary products, as
in the "Loss Leader" model; in fact, if the proper open-source license
were chosen (e.g., a BSD-style license or the Mozilla Public License) then
newer proprietary products could be based in part on code from older products
now released as open source.
<P>There would be two main tactical problems to overcome in successfully
implementing a "Sell It, Free It" strategy. The first would be deciding
exactly the right time in the product's life cycle to convert it to open
source; doing it too early might mean unnecessarily forgoing significant
license revenues, while doing it too late might lessen the interest of
open source developers in contributing to the product's further development.
The second problem is related to the first: If customers think the product
is likely to be converted to open source at some point then it is more
difficult to justify to them why they should buy it now rather than waiting.
The problem becomes more tractable if the product's sales cycle is short
relative to the product's life cycle (otherwise price reductions or conversion
to open source are likely before customers complete their buying decisions)
and if product pricing is managed so as to plan for scheduled reductions
in license price and at least partially compensate for such reductions
with revenue from other sources, such as technical support or professional
services.
<P>In a fully-realized "Sell It, Free It" model customers buying the product
near the beginning of its life cycle are in essence paying a premium for
the value of having the software earlier rather than later, and license
pricing can reflect this value. Once the product converts to open source
it becomes in essence a commodity, but it can still add value to newer
proprietary products, whose license pricing can reflect that added value.
<H4>
<A NAME="brand-licensing"></A>Brand Licensing</H4>
In the "Brand Licensing" model a company makes the software product itself
open source but retains the rights to its product trademarks and related
intellectual property, and charges other companies for the right to use
those trademarks in creating derivative products distributed under the
exact same brand name. This of course requires that the product exist in
at least two different forms with two different names: the "official" product
referred to by a trademarked name, and the "unofficial" product referred
to by a separate name.
<P>Using this model was not possible with traditional free software products
because the product "brand names" (as it were) were typically not formally
registered as trademarks. (In the case of Linux this caused a <A HREF="http://www.li.org/News/trademark.html">dispute</A>
requiring legal action to resolve.) However a commercial product being
converted to open source will almost always have associated with it trademarks
in the form of product names and logos, and these can remain under the
control of the company. For example, even though Netscape released source
code for the Netscape Communicator product, only Netscape (or authorized
Netscape licensees) can use the source code to create a product called
"Netscape Communicator;" products built by others from the source are typically
referred to by the name "Mozilla" (from the original code name for Netscape
Navigator 1.0).
<P>In general the two product versions (with and without associated trademarks)
could be built from identical or near-identical source code; however from
the perspective of the market they would be two different products with
possibly different perceived value. (For example, the branded product may
have undergone additional testing and validation not done with the non-branded
product.) If you convert a product to open source then a third party wishing
to distribute a product based on that source (for example, for distribution
as part of a special on-line service) may also wish to separately pay you
for a license to use your trademarks in association with that product.
The price of that license can reflect the brand value and reputation that
your company (and by association, your trademarks) have in the marketplace.
<P>(I should note that even though I've used Netscape as an example here,
Netscape has not publicly announced any plans to license its trademarks
as described above.)
<H4>
<A NAME="software-franchising"></A>Software Franchising</H4>
"Software Franchising" is a possible business model based on taking to
their logical conclusion the ideas of some of the preceding models, in
particular "Brand Licensing" and "Support Sellers." The "raw materials"
underlying a support seller's business are available to anyone, but it's
reasonable to assume that some may be better at the business than others
and as a result may build value in a particular brand associated with the
company's services. If the company then wishes to expand, one possibility
would be to grow not through direct hiring and acquisition but rather through
franchising; in other words, the company would authorize other developers
to use its brand names and trademarks in creating associated organizations
doing open-source support and custom software development in particular
geographic areas or vertical markets.
<P>In this model the "software franchisor" would not only license brands
and trademarks but also supply franchisees with training (e.g., in specific
aspects of running an open-source development effort and support seller
business) and services (e.g., centralized support for contracting and procurement,
advertising and marketing campaigns). Revenues would come from sources
such as sales of franchises and royalties based on franchisees' revenues.
<H3>
<A NAME="hybrid-business-models"></A>Hybrid business models</H3>
The business models discussed in the previous section are all based on
open-source software in one way or another, with that software licensed
under a true open-source license along the lines of that recommended by
the Open Source Definition; if a business also involves software that is
not open-source (as for example in the "Loss Leader" model), then the software
is assumed to be totally proprietary or "closed-source," i.e., the company
does not make its source available except under very restrictive licenses.
<P>However there are possible business models that involve software distributed
under licenses that are not quite open-source in the strict sense, but
are also not as restrictive as traditional proprietary licenses. One way
to explore the space of possible "hybrid" business models is to go back
to the Open Source Definition and look at relaxing one or more of its requirements;
here are some changes that might be made:
<UL>
<LI>
change the availability of source code</LI>

<LI>
change the treatment of different users</LI>

<LI>
change the treatment of different types of use</LI>
</UL>
Let's consider these in more detail, along with two examples of organizations
pursuing such hybrid models: <A HREF="http://www.troll.no/">Troll Tech</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.opengroup.org/">The Open Group</A>.
<H4>
<A NAME="source-availability"></A>Changing availability of source code</H4>
An open-source license grants at least four separate rights with regard
to source code:
<UL>
<LI>
the right to view (i.e., to see the code in the first place and possess
a copy of it)</LI>

<LI>
the right to use (i.e., to compile the source into executable form and
run the resulting application)</LI>

<LI>
the right to modify (i.e., to make changes to the source code)</LI>

<LI>
the right to redistribute (i.e., to give the source code to a third party,
potentially in either modified or unmodified form)</LI>
</UL>
All these rights come bundled together and are available "for free;" i.e.,
the developer does not charge the user any license fees to have them.
<P>However at least in theory these rights could be separated and could
be made conditional on paying some sort of license fee. (Some might object
that there are no technical means to enforce such separation; for example,
if someone has a copy of the code and can use it to build an executable,
there is no way to prevent them from modifying it. This is true, but in
practice such considerations have not been a major problem in commercial
software licensing; for example, although many software products are now
available over the Internet for downloading (e.g., for evaluation use)
and thus there is no technical way to enforce payment for a right-to-use
license, nevertheless almost all commercial and government organizations
do in fact "pay up" and officially acquire licenses if their users end
up using the product -- particularly if the organizations are prompted
to do so.)
<P>Thus, for example, users could be given a low-cost or even no-cost license
to possess a copy of product source code, compile it for internal use,
and make bug fixes as necessary, but would be charged a higher license
fee if they wished to redistribute modified versions. (Returning bug fixes
to the original vendor could be exempted from this restriction.) Such licensing
terms would likely not be attractive to many if not most noncommercial
developers, but might be acceptable and of interest to many commercial
organizations. If the product serves a very specialized market then it
is quite possible that only commercial users would be interested in the
source code anyway, so that a lack of participation by noncommercial developers
would not necessarily always be a drawback.
<P>As a real-life example, Troll Tech distributes a <A HREF="http://www.troll.no/qtfree.html">free
version</A> of its <A HREF="http://www.troll.no/products/qt.html">Qt GUI
toolkit</A> , including source code; the <A HREF="http://www.troll.no/free-license.html">Qt
Free Edition license</A> allows developers to view, use, and modify the
source code, but prohibits them from distributing modifications.
<H4>
<A NAME="different-users"></A>Changing treatment of different users</H4>
An open-source license is available to all potential users no matter who
they are. (The Open Source Definition specifies that an open source license
may not discriminate between users based on "fields on endeavor," which
in essence is saying the same thing.) However in general a source license
could be offered on different terms to one group of users versus another;
the most common and probably the most useful distinction is made between
commercial and noncommercial users. (Note that this distinction is not
always easily made in general; for example, there are many instances of
large organizations which are technically nonprofits but which are in many
ways indistinguishable from for-profit entities performing similar functions.
In practice it would be up to the software vendor to decide to which class
a particular user would be assigned.)
<P>Thus, for example, noncommercial users could be given a full set of
rights to the source (rights to view, use, modify, and redistribute), but
the vendor might charge commercial users license fees to obtain all or
some of those rights. A real-life example of this is the new <A HREF="http://www.camb.opengroup.org/x/">X11R6.4</A>
release of the X Window System from The Open Group; X11R6.4 source code
is available under a <A HREF="http://www.camb.opengroup.org/tech/desktop/onlineorder/xdownload.htm">noncommercial
license</A> at no charge; however users wishing to distribute binaries
for <A HREF="http://www.camb.opengroup.org/tech/desktop/ordering/index.htm#x11">commercial
purposes</A> must pay <A HREF="http://www.camb.opengroup.org/tech/desktop/ordering/x.price.list.htm">a
fee</A> for a separate <A HREF="http://www.osf.org/direct/MasterSWLicTC.html">commercial
license</A>. Troll Tech also prohibits commercial use of the Qt Free Edition,
and sells a separate <A HREF="http://www.troll.no/pricing.html">Qt Professional
Edition</A> for that purpose.
<H4>
<A NAME="types-of-use"></A>Changing treatment of different types of use</H4>
An open-source license does not discriminate between different uses of
the software; a given user may use the software in any context and for
any purpose they wish. However in general a source license could have restrictions
limiting the use of the software for certain purposes, or could be offered
on different terms (including different prices) depending on the end use.
<P>Thus, for example, a source license could allow personal use or internal
use within an organization at low cost or no cost, but prohibit or require
higher license fees for use of the software to provide a service to other
users (e.g., on the Internet or as part of an extranet). Alternatively,
the license could allow no-charge use of the software on particular operating
system and/or hardware platforms (e.g., Linux) but require that a license
fee be paid to use the software on other platforms (e.g., Windows 95 or
Solaris). As a real-life example, Troll Tech restricts the Qt Free Edition
to being used only under the X Window System (e.g., on Linux and various
Unix-based systems); developers wishing a version of Qt for Windows 95
or other platforms must license Qt Professional Edition.
<H4>
<A NAME="hybrid-viability"></A>Viability of hybrid models</H4>
A company using a hybrid business model can derive revenue and profits
directly from the sale of licenses for the software in question as opposed
to deriving revenue and profits only through more indirect means, as in
an open-source business model. The question is whether such a company can
also gain the other benefits of open-source business models such as leveraging
outside developers to help improve its software and drive its adoption
in the market. Although commercial developers presumably would have no
qualms about working with hybrid software, many noncommercial developers
would likely object to the more restrictive terms of hybrid licenses versus
open-source licenses.
<P>For example, The Open Group aroused widespread controversy when they
changed the licensing terms for X11R6.4 to use separate commercial and
noncommercial licenses as opposed to the single BSD-style license previously
used; among other things this resulted in a split in X11 development, with
the <A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86 Project</A> deciding to <A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/news/pr-980407.html">not
use X11R6.4</A> or other future releases from The Open Group, instead continuing
development based on X11R6.3.
<P>Similarly, although Troll Tech has attempted to <A HREF="http://www.troll.no/faq/faq-freeedition.html">justify
its business model</A> to the open-source developer community and has established
a <A HREF="http://www.troll.no/announce/foundation.html">foundation</A>
to help ensure that Qt Free Edition will never become a proprietary product,
nevertheless many in that community still see Troll Tech's licensing policies
as inconsistent with the goals of the free software movement. This has
resulted in a rivalry of sorts between proponents of Qt and the Qt-based
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">K
Desktop Environment</A> (KDE) and proponents of the <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</A>
toolkit and <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A> desktop environment,
which are distributed under the LGPL and GPL. It has also resulted in the
formation of a separate project (known as <A HREF="http://web.jet.es/jg_yiyus/harmony/">Harmony</A>)
to build a Qt-compatible library to be distributed under the LGPL.
<H2>
<A NAME="issues-and-tactics"></A>Issues and tactics</H2>
Beyond selecting an appropriate license and business model, what else might
your company have to do in order to implement an open-source strategy?
This depends to a large extent on whether you will be converting an existing
proprietary product to open source or writing an open-source product from
scratch; the former is more likely, since even if your open-source product
is not simply a new version of an existing product it is quite likely that
you'll want to at least reuse code that already exists in other of your
products.
<P>When converting an existing product or reusing existing code it's likely
you'll have to address the following issues:
<UL>
<LI>
sharing existing code among open-source products and proprietary products</LI>

<LI>
what to do about code in your products licensed from third parties</LI>

<LI>
for US companies, how to comply with relevant export control regulations
on cryptography</LI>

<LI>
what other sorts of "sanitization" you will have to do on your source code</LI>
</UL>
I discuss possible tactics to resolve such issues. In addition, I briefly
discuss the open-source development process and how you might organize
software development for your open-source product or products.
<H3>
<A NAME="source-code-sharing"></A>Source code sharing among products</H3>
If you have only one software product and that product is or will be open
source, or if you are writing an open-source product totally from scratch,
then you can skip this section. However if you have multiple software products
and especially if those products currently share source code in any way
(e.g., they call common libraries or even just have a few routines or header
files in common) then you will have to consider the issue of how your open-source
product can "coexist" with your other products and how you might have to
change your products and your development process to accomodate this. (This
section assumes that you hold copyright to the source code in question;
if some of the source code is licensed from third parties please see the
next section.)
<P>Unfortunately some open-source licences make it difficult to impossible
to share source code between an open-source product and a proprietary product;
the presence of code from the open-source product in the proprietary product
can trigger licensing provisions that in theory force disclosure of source
code from the proprietary product as well. (As discussed previously in
relation to the GPL, this "tainting" effect is a feature, not a bug, of
the open-source licenses in question.) On the face of it this would preclude
(for example) maintaining common libraries used by both sets of products.
Short of enforcing a strict separation of code between the products, there
are several ways to approach this issue; in either case you must first
identify all the source files which are or will be shared, and single them
out for special treatment.
<P>This first approach is to use an open-source license that does not taint
in any way; a BSD-style license is the obvious choice. If you release all
the common code under such a license then it can included in any type of
product without any untoward consequences arising from the licensing provisions.
If someone outside your company contributes changes under the same license
then you are free to incorporate those chances into your common code and
still use that code with your proprietary products. (For that matter, you
could incorporate such changes directly into a proprietary product.)
<P>If for other reasons you want or need to use a strongly tainting open-source
license like the GPL, a second approach is to put your common code under
two licenses: your existing proprietary license and the separate open-source
license. (Since you hold copyright to the code, as assumed above, you have
the right to license it how you please.) When the source files in question
are included in your open-source product then the open-source license is
in effect; when included in your proprietary products the proprietary license
is in effect. The major drawback of this approach is that if someone outside
your organization contributes changes to one of the shared source files
under the open-source license then you will either have to avoid using
the contributed open-source code in the shared routine (because of the
possibility of tainting your proprietary products) or ask special permission
of the contributor to use the code under the proprietary license as well.
Either alternative imposes a burden on your development and legal staff
to track changes, secure permissions, and so on. It also raises the possibility
of open-source development efforts around your product splitting into two
incompatible "forks:" one based on the code as released by you (with only
your changes or changes for which you have permission to do dual licensing)
and one based on the code with all changes contributed under the open-source
license.
<P>If the shared code is in the form of a common library or libraries accessed
through a set of defined APIs, then a third approach is to release the
common code under an open-source license like the LGPL or MozPL which does
not taint across library or source file boundaries. In this case the common
library itself is a pure open-source product in and of itself (no dual
licensing is needed, and the library can be released as a separate stand-alone
open-source product); your proprietary products can call that library under
the specific exemptions granted by the license. (The MozPL is somewhat
more liberal than the LGPL in this respect, as previously discussed.) Note
that the rest of the open-source product (the part that calls the common
library) can be under any open-source license compatible with the LGPL
or MozPL; this includes all the licenses previously discussed: GPL, MozPL,
BSD-style licenses, and the Artistic License.
<P>However it may be that you do not wish such a common library to be open
source but rather want to keep it proprietary. (For example, the library
may include code you do not have rights to release or do not wish to release,
e.g., to protect trade secrets.) This poses no problem for your proprietary
products calling that library, and you could use the same (proprietary)
license for both sets of code. However if you wish to call the proprietary
library from the open-source product, then you'll need to license the open-source
code under a license that permits this usage; the MozPL or BSD-style licenses
would work here, the GPL would not.
<P>You would also have to face the issue of how open-source developers
would be able to create a complete product on their own as part of the
open-source development process: If the proprietary library is critical
to the functioning of your open-source product, then you would have to
supply binary versions of the library for them to link to. Such a library
would have to be provided at no charge, in order that the final open-source
product (including the library) be licensable at no charge in source or
binary form (as specified by the Open Source Definition). You would also
have to provide the binary version of the library on all platforms of interest
to open-source developers, because they're not going to be able to port
it themselves in the absence of library source code. (On the other hand,
given that the API to the library is known, they can in the long run simply
create a true open-source equivalent to the proprietary library.)
<P>A final note: Many developers and corporate legal staff are not familar
with the nuances of open-source licenses and may be very concerned just
about the presence of open-source code "within the firewall," and in particular
on the same systems or in the same source code repositories as proprietary
code. These concerns while exaggerated are nonetheless understandable,
given the theoretical possibility of tainting; however these concerns can
be easily addressed by familiarizing people with how open-source licenses
work and enforcing some minimal policies in dealing with open source. In
particular, no open-source license in use today (including the GPL) causes
tainting when open-source code resides on the same storage medium with
proprietary code (or is "aggregated with" such code, as the GPL puts it).
Thus it is perfectly safe, for example, to maintain code for a GPL-ed or
other open-source product in the same source repository used to maintain
proprietary code, if the open-source code is in a separate part of the
repository and is not linked with or otherwise combined with proprietary
code.
<H3>
<A NAME="third-party-technology"></A>Third-party technology</H3>
Many of your products probably incorporate technology from other companies,
licensed in either source or binary form; how can you handle such technology
in the context of an overall strategy of distributing open source code
for a product? This depends on the particular licensing terms that have
been or could be negotiated with the third-party technology supplier, and
in particular whether the third party is already pursuing or is supportive
of an open-source strategy.
<P>The first and hardest case is where your license with the technology
supplier constrains you to shipping only the binary form of their code,
and only embedded in the binary form of your product; the license may also
prohibit you from disclosing the APIs by which your product interfaces
to the third-party product, with such APIs being considered proprietary
to the third-party. If the third-party technology is critical enough to
your product and if the license terms and conditions are too restrictive
then it is quite possible that you may not be able to release your own
source code at all, either for the entire product or for a major component
of
it. In this case it is probably worth asking the third party to see if
their restrictions could be relaxed in some way; it is possible that some
middle way exists that would allow you to distribute at least partial source
code while still complying with relevant license requirements.
<P>The second case is where the supplied technology is already or could
be encapsulated in a wholly separate binary component intended to be accessed
by a public API, and the license reflects this usage. One example would
be a shared library for a graphical user interface toolkit such as Motif;
another more specific example is an add-on module like a browser plug-in.
Here you have the option of releasing your own source code (since you are
using public APIs), and the end user or developer can separately acquire
and license the separate component from the third party. (For example,
the required library or libraries might already be included as part of
a user's operating system.)
<P>The third case is where the third-party component(s) cannot be made
available at all (for whatever reason), but the APIs are still public.
Here you have the option of releasing your own code but leaving it up to
the customer to find a substitute for any omitted components. Assuming
a clever and active open-source developer community working with your source
code, this could quite possibly lead to the creation of substitute technology
for the original supplier's technology, a substitute that would almost
certainly be available under more favorable licensing terms. If you
wish you could then potentially adopt the substitute technology instead,
or simply accept the existence of two possible versions: a public version
using the open-source technology and your own version using the proprietary
technology. (This assumes that the open-source license you're using permits
you to link your code with proprietary code; for example, the GNU General
Public License prohibits this.)
<P>The final case is where the third-party supplier is willing to release
their own source code. In the longer term, if the open-source movement
proves successful, there may be technology suppliers willing to use it,
especially if they come to believe that this is ultimately in their interest
by providing them with new ways to make money as well. This should
be a major focus of the open-source movement as a whole, because (among
other things) outside developers adding features to open-source products
could in turn become technology suppliers to the vendors of those products,
and to encourage this those vendors should work to ensure that their suppliers
would share in some way in the overall rewards of the business.
<H3>
<A NAME="other-sanitization"></A>Other source code sanitization</H3>
Most companies developing proprietary closed-source products treat the
contents of their source code as a purely internal matter and have assumed
that it will forever remain so (with the possible exception of tightly-controlled
release to a partner under NDA). If you have traditionally operated this
way and are now considering a move to open source (even if only partially)
then you will quite likely be concerned with releasing source code for
fear of inadvertently exposing material which might embarrass you in some
way or be otherwise damaging to your company should someone happen to come
across it. Examples include bugs both minor and major, security flaws,
and embarrassing comments by developers; the latter could potentially include
comments disparaging the code itself (e.g., "what a brain-dead hack"),
the quality of your products ("fix #1,000,001 for this turkey"),
or particular of your customers ("patch for the idiots at Acme Widgets"),
as well as the standard "seven dirty words" and other language not suitable
for material intended to be in universal public distribution.
<P>Bugs and security flaws you need worry less about; if you don't know
about them already (and can fix them prior to open-source release) then
they will sooner or later be found (and possibly fixed) by developers outside
your company. This is by no means a bad thing; rather it's one of the claimed
benefits of open source and such investigation and bug fixing should only
be encouraged. As for embarrassing comments and the like, these can and
should be removed during the work to prepare the source for initial release;
you will need to do such "sanitization" work for every source file to be
released, with someone assigned to review and if necessary modify each
file. (This need not be a single person; rather for each file it should
be the person or persons most responsible for the source code in that file.)
This sanitization review serves other purposes as well, since (as discussed
elsewhere) you will also need to identify source code licensed from third
parties, source code affected by export control or other regulations, and
source code not intended for release for other reasons.
<P>However you still need to address the sanitization issue for new code
developed later. The most straightforward approach to address the issue
of public releasability in the long-term is probably to have developers
understand that they are "writing for publication" and that each and every
line of their code will likely be viewed both by customers and (even more
important) by their peers in the developer community. Within the context
of an open-source code strategy you can no longer treat source code as
an internal-only matter, but will have to exercise just as much care as
you (ideally should) exercise with released binaries and documentation.
This might require extra editing steps and code reviews, greater adherence
to consistent formatting conventions (at least within particular sets of
modules), inclusion of proper licensing notices, and related actions; the
immediate responsibility for ensuring this happens rests with the module
owners (whether they are employed by you or not).
<H3>
US export control issues</H3>
(This section is addressed specifically to organizations and individuals
in the US; if you are based in another country please consult your local
laws and regulations. This discussion is for informational purposes only
and is not intended as legal advice. If you wish to develop and distribute
cryptographic software then you should consult an attorney with expertise
in the particular laws and regulations that apply in your jurisdiction.)
<P>So far I've assumed that you would have compete discretion over whether
you wished to release your own source code or not, as well as over how
much of that source you would choose to release. However there is one key
area, namely security-related and cryptographic code, where you are and
will almost certainly continue to be constrained in major ways regarding
distribution of binary and source code; given activity in the US Congress
and Administration over the past year or two, it is even possible that
those constraints will become even more restrictive in the future than
they are today. It's therefore useful to review how much freedom of action
you are likely to have in this area, and how that might affect your open-source
distribution strategy.
<P>Under the current <A HREF="http://jya.com/eartoc.htm">regulatory regime</A>,
US companies and individuals are prohibited from exporting from the US
(except to Canada) software that implements strong encryption (e.g., using
greater than a 40-bit symmetric encryption key). Thus at a minimum you
would be prohibited from exporting source code that implemented such cryptography.
(However you could distribute such source code within the US and Canada,
at least for the present, as long as you take appropriate precautions and
implement appropriate controls in your software distribution mechanisms
to comply with the relevant regulations.)
<P>However the restrictions are actually more onerous than that. The US
government has traditionally refused to permit the export of products in
which the supplied weak cryptography could be easily replaced with strong
cryptographic implementations developed outside the US. For example, the
source code for the <A HREF="http://www.imc.org/sfl/">S/MIME Freeware Library</A>
(SFL) is considered to be an export-controlled item with controlled distribution,
even though the source does not actually include any cryptographic code.
It's therefore reasonable to conclude that even under the current regulatory
regime you will not be able to export source code to security libraries
implementing functions such as S/MIME, SSL, PKCS#7, IPSec, etc., and will
also be required to remove from the released source code calls to routines
in such libraries.
<P>Finally, it's possible that the US government may decide to impose further
restrictions in the future as part of attempts to regulate domestic use
of cryptography within the US. For example, it may be that US software
vendors will be prohibited in the future from shipping any product with
encryption functionality unless it implements a key escrow scheme of some
type. Assuming that the escrow scheme is enforced by your security library
or libraries, you may be prohibited from distributing such security-related
source code even within the US and Canada, on the grounds that others (within
the US or not) could easily create a derivative work that disabled key
escrow.
<P>The ultimate question is where the U.S. government will "draw the line"
in terms of attempting to exercise control over the use of cryptography
by imposing restrictions on commercial software vendors and noncommercial
developers. Given that US software vendors and developers have only limited
influence over the future of cryptography regulations, if you decide to
pursue a open-source strategy then the best that you can do is simply to
distribute your security-related source code to the maximum extent permitted
by relevant laws and regulations both in the US and worldwide. For a real-life
example of the complications inherent in doing so, see the <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/crypto-faq.html">Mozilla
Crypto FAQ</A>.
<H3>
Open-source development processes</H3>
Suppose that you release one of your products as open source (whether an
existing product or new). How could you possibly coordinate the efforts
of potentially hundreds or even thousands of developers worldwide who might
be creating bug fixes, customized versions, and add-on products all based
on your source code?
<P>At first glance this would seem to be impossible. However there is at
least one example of a successful project involving distributed and relatively
loosely-coordinated development of software products arguably at least
as complex and functional as any commercial products, namely the project
to create the Linux operating system and the body of free software that
runs on top of it. The Linux project offers many lessons on how you might
potentially organize software development in the context of an open-source
strategy. These are discussed at greater length in the paper <A HREF="http://sagan.earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">"The
Cathedral and the Bazaar"</A> by Eric Raymond, but some key points can
be summarized here as follows, together with implications for you should
you wish to pursue such a strategy:
<UL>
<LI>
Properly organized and coordinated, distributed development can produce
more products faster and with higher quality than would be possible in
an isolated effort. As Raymond puts it, "The developer who uses only his
or her own brain in a closed project is going to fall behind the developer
who knows how to create an open, evolutionary context in which bug-spotting
and improvements get done by hundreds of people." Substitute "software
company" for "developer" and you have a basic theme of this paper; my suggestion
is that this approach offers you one way to compete successfully with larger
competitors without having their internal resources.</LI>

<LI>
Distributed development is jump-started and proceeds most rapidly when
there is an existing body of code in which developers can see the promise
of solutions to problems which interest them, and which developers can
use a base for their own work to solve those problems. One of your major
roles would be to provide this existing source code base initially, and
to continue to seed it with new contributions in the form of new product
features with accompanying source code.</LI>

<LI>
Higher-quality code can be generated faster when you can enlist other people
to do not only bug detection and reporting, but bug fixing as well; bug
fixers are in turn more motivated when you do frequent releases that incorporate
their fixes and enable them to see the fruits of their efforts. Here you
would need good mechanisms to ensure that bug fixes from other developers
are in fact incorporated back into your source tree. This is both
easier and harder than using the Internet as your beta test site, as many
software companies are now doing: On the one hand, developers with access
to source would be much more likely to not only find problems but also
reproduce, diagnose, and fix them. On the other hand, they would have a
much higher expectation of having their contributions taken seriously by
you; they would request or even demand access to the actual developers
working on the components, and would be even more turned off than regular
users if they received little or no response to their communications with
you.</LI>

<LI>
The Internet and the collaborative tools built on top of it (email, newsgroups,
etc.) form an indispensable infrastructure for the coordination of distributed
developers but you can realize the true promise of distributed development
only if you provide the proper social context for it, including having
development coordinators with the necessary social and communications skills
to "lead without coercion" and focus developers' energies into productive
channels. Thus to make an open-source strategy work you would have to put
the proper effort into selecting the teams and team leaders chosen to develop
products according to this strategy; in particular it would be very helpful
if your developers had previous experience with open-source projects.</LI>
</UL>
It is important to note that there is no "free lunch" here: You cannot
simply release source code, put a few newsgroups up, and expect distributed
development to magically self-organize; you would need to make a sustained
effort involving various people's time and attention in order to get a
distributed open-source development effort to the point where it would
produce results. However I believe that the potential rewards are worth
the effort, and that you could not necessarily achieve comparable results
by continuing your current development practices.

Acknowledgments</H3>
This paper recycles a fair amount of material from a paper I originally
wrote in the late summer and fall of 1997 for internal distribution at
Netscape. The original paper was inspired by discussions on various Netscape
internal newsgroups over the years about the possibility of releasing Netscape
source code; in particular two independent postings from <A HREF="http://people.netscape.com/jwz/">Jamie
Zawinski</A> and <A HREF="mailto:ekrock@netscape.com">Eric Krock</A> provided
the immediate impetus for me to start writing down my thoughts on this
subject. Special thanks go to the two main reviewers of that original paper:
<A HREF="http://www.menk.com/">John
Menkart</A> of Netscape's government sales group, with whom I discussed
business models and licensing issues, and Jamie Zawinski, who provided
useful information on software development according to the GNU and Linux
models, including a pointer to Eric Raymond's paper <A HREF="http://sagan.earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">"The
Cathedral and the Bazaar."</A>
<P>Further material and inspiration for the current paper came from the
<A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.license">public
discussions</A> on the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License,
from the material created by Eric Raymond, Bruce Perens, and other for
the <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">OpenSource.Org</A> web site, and
from articles, editorials, and user discussions on the <A HREF="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot.org</A>
web site.
<P>Finally, full credit must be given to two groups of people at Netscape:
to the executive management team (Jim Barksdale, Marc Andreessen, Eric
Hahn, Mike Homer, etc.) that committed Netscape to an open-source strategy,
and especially to those in the Netscape client engineering group and elsewhere
who worked long hours to implement that strategy and succeeded in making
their 31 March 1998 deadline for source code release, creating an innovative
pair of licenses in the MozPL and NPL, and putting <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/">mozilla.org</A>
and Mozilla source development on a firm footing for the future; all the
theorizing in the world would have been fruitless without their efforts.
