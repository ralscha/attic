<BLOCKQUOTE> <STRONG>Summary</STRONG><BR> 
This month we slip behind the scenes to catch a glimpse of Java's
image handling framework. We'll be examining two key
components of the framework: the <CODE>ImageProducer</CODE> interface
and the <CODE>ImageConsumer</CODE> interface. As a bonus, I'll also
show you how to build your own image producers and image consumers.

<P> 
<font size="+3">N</font>ot content with the complete set of graphics
primitives provided by the <CODE>Graphics</CODE>, many
programmers still find that they need more flexibility; simply loading
and displaying images within an applet or application often doesn't
make the grade. In these cases, the only solution is to create images
on the fly. Such a task is made possible by Java's powerful
image-handling framework and the two interfaces that make it up.

<P>
Before we get too deep into our latest image endeavor, let's review
what we learned about images in the preceeding <strong>How-To Java</strong> column.

<p><font size="+1"><strong>A crash course in image handling</strong></font><br>

Recall that delay is an inherent property of the network-based
environment in which Java applets and many Java applications live.
Because Java applets and many Java applications depend heavily on
resources (classes and media) that are initially available only
remotely, the designers of the Java class library had to address the
delay posed by network transactions. The result of their efforts was a
system in which images are fetched asynchronously, possibly in another thread.

<P>
The most visible player in the image game is the <CODE>Image</CODE>
class. An instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class represents an image,
but it does not need to contain the data that makes up the image -- the
<CODE>Image</CODE> class provides methods for obtaining information
about the image represented by an instance of the class. Due to network
delay, information about an image might not be immediately available.
Therefore, each method requires, as a parameter, an instance of a class
that implements the <CODE>ImageObserver</CODE> interface.

<P>
Whew! That's a whole lot of information crammed into a very small
space. If you find that you're scratching your head wondering what this
is all about, check out <A HREF="/javaworld/jw-02-1997/jw-02-howto.html">last month's column</A>, for more information.

<p><font size="+1"><strong>Uncovering the power of the the producer/consumer model</strong></font><br>

The developers of the Java class library used the producer/consumer
model as the basis for the library's low-level image-handling API. This
model, which has several advantages we'll examine in a minute, consists
of two tightly coupled components:  producers and consumers. You may
have been able to guess the components' names, but understanding what
they do requires some explanation. Let's take a look.

<P>
Image producers are objects that produce image data. An image producer
may generate image data itself, or it may provide access to image data
in a particular image format (GIF, JPEG). All image producers
implement the <CODE>ImageProducer</CODE> interface. Image consumers, on
the other hand, are objects that consume image data. Once the image
data is consumed, the object is then free to use (or modify) it. All
image consumers implement the <CODE>ImageConsumer</CODE> interface.

<P>
As I mentioned a moment ago, the producer/consumer model has several
advantages: it's modular, which means that existing producers and
consumers can be used interchangeably, and new producers and consumers
fit seamlessly into the existing framework; and it lends itself to
asynchronous interaction, which means that once a connection between a
producer and a consumer is made, the producer notifies the consumer
only when more information is available. Meanwhile, the applet or
application is free to do other work.

<P>
In addition to these benefits, the producer/consumer model is also an
intuitive description for two collaborating objects in a
network-based environment. Producers represent resources located on the
other side of the network; consumers represent the applet or
application located on this side of the network. Together they
provide the machinery that gets the resource data from there to here.

<p><font size="+1"><strong>Observing the role of the producer and 
consumer components </strong></font><br>

Now that you've got the fundamentals of the producer/consumer model
securely under your belt, take a look at Listing 1, which demonstrates
the way images are typically created and used in an applet.

<PRE>
public class New extends Applet
{
   private Image _im = null;

   public void init()
   {
      // getDocumentBase() returns the URL of the
      //   document that contains this applet
      _im = getImage(getDocumentBase(), &quot;fig.gif&quot;); // step 1

      // because this is an applet, &quot;this&quot; refers to an
      //   instance of the Applet class... which just
      //   happens to be an image observer
      prepareImage(_im, this);                      // step 2
   }

   public void paint(Graphics g)
   {
      // see the comment about &quot;this&quot; above... 
      g.drawImage(_im, 50, 50, this);               // step 3
   }
}
</PRE>

<P>
<CENTER><EM>Listing 1: Image handling in a typical applet</CENTER></EM><P>

<P>
Let's examine the three steps that take place in this listing:

<OL>
<LI>An instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class is created
<LI>An instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class is prepared
<LI>An image is drawn
</OL>

<P> 
You may recall from last month's column that the two last steps cause
image reconstruction to begin. The <CODE>prepareImage</CODE> and
<CODE>drawImage</CODE> methods used in these two steps require an
instance of an image observer, which is not really part of the
producer/consumer model. Instead, image observers are a convenient
appendage whose functionality is underwritten by the
<CODE>Component</CODE> class. If a request can't be immediately
satisfied because image reconstruction is not complete, the component
notifies the image observer when reconstruction is complete. The image
observer can then act upon this information. In order to learn what
role image producers and image consumers play in the demonstration
above, we must take a look behind the scenes.

<P>
First, the creation of an instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class
requires the existence of an image producer. In our demonstration, code
deep within the AWT creates the image producer; alternately, the
programmer can supply the image producer when the <CODE>Image</CODE> object
is created.

<P>
Second, attempting to prepare or to draw an instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE>
class (in fact, attempting to invoke any of methods that require
an image observer) causes an image consumer to be created deep
within the AWT and reconstruction to begin.

<P>
Finally, as reconstruction occurs the image consumer stores the
image data and ensures that the supplied image observer is
notified.

<P>
If the applet itself is used as the image observer, as was the case in
last month's demonstrations, we get a better magic show. The
<CODE>Component</CODE> class (from which the <CODE>Applet</CODE> class
is derived) supplies an <CODE>updateImage()</CODE> method that calls
the <CODE>Component</CODE> object's <CODE>repaint()</CODE> method. This
schedules another painting operation, during which the image (now
containing additional image data) will be redrawn. 

<p>
<font size="+1"><strong>Creating your own custom image producer</strong></font><br>

Last month I described how an <CODE>Image</CODE> object could be
created from image data fetched across the network. I also mentioned
two other ways to create an <CODE>Image</CODE> object: from an
<CODE>Image</CODE> object representing an off-screen image and directly
from an <CODE>ImageProducer</CODE> object. The first technique has been
discussed at length elsewhere (due primarily to its role in animation
-- see the <EM>JavaWorld</EM> article "<A HREF="/javaworld/jw-03-1996/jw-03-animation.html">Animation in Java Applets</A>" by Arthur van Hoff and Kathy Walrath for
a detailed look at this technique), so we'll deal with the second. Take
a look at the following method, which is provided by the
<CODE>Component</CODE> class:

<P>
<CODE>public Image createImage(ImageProducer ip)</CODE>

<P>
The <CODE>createImage</CODE> method takes an instance of a class that
implements the <CODE>ImageProducer</CODE> interface and creates an
instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class. This <CODE>Image</CODE>
object can then be manipulated in the same manner as any other
<CODE>Image</CODE> object.

<P>
A class that implements the <CODE>ImageProducer</CODE> interface must
provide definitions for five methods. The first three methods

<P>
<CODE>public void addConsumer(ImageConsumer ic)</CODE>

<P>
<CODE>public void removeConsumer(ImageConsumer ic)</CODE>

<P>
<CODE>public boolean isConsumer(ImageConsumer ic)</CODE>

<P>
are responsible for adding and removing image
consumers from the list of those items that are interested in the state
of the image producer. They require an instance of an
<CODE>ImageConsumer</CODE> as a parameter. 

<P>
The method

<P>
<CODE>public void requestTopDownLeftRightResend(ImageConsumer ic)</CODE>

<P>
allows an image consumer to request that the image producer resend the
image data in top-down, left-to-right order. If the image producer
cannot resend the image data in this order, it may ignore this
request.

<P>
Finally, the method

<P>
<CODE>public void startProduction(ImageConsumer ic)</CODE>

<P>
allows an image consumer to request that the image producer start image
production.

<P>
Listing 2 shows the implementations of the first three methods. Note
that the <CODE>_v</CODE> variable is a reference to an instance of the
<CODE>Vector</CODE> class. Listing 3 shows one possible definition of
the <CODE>startProduction()</CODE> method. In this example, the image
producer generates the image data within the body of its
<CODE>startProduction()</CODE> method; however, we could have easily
started another thread and let it generate the image data.

<P>
Note: The definitions in these listings are part of an image producer that
generates a small 128-by-128 pixel image.

<PRE>
public void addConsumer(ImageConsumer ic) 
{
   if (isConsumer(ic) == false) _v.addElement(ic); 
}

public void removeConsumer(ImageConsumer ic) 
{
   if (isConsumer(ic) == true) _v.removeElement(ic); 
}

public boolean isConsumer(ImageConsumer ic) 
{
   return _v.indexOf(ic) &gt; -1; 
}
</PRE>

<P>
<CENTER><EM>Listing 2: Image consumer maintenance</CENTER></EM><P>


<PRE>
public void startProduction(ImageConsumer ic)
{
   addConsumer(ic);

   // create a 128x128 element buffer

   int x = 128;
   int y = 128;

   int [] rgn = new int [x * y];

   for (int i = 0; i < x * y; i++) rgn[i] = i * 2;

   // create the properties hashtable

   Hashtable ht = new Hashtable();

   // create the default color model

   ColorModel cm = new DirectColorModel(24, 0x0000FF, 0x00FF00, 0xFF0000);

   // clone the vector containing consumers

   Vector v = (Vector)_v.clone();

   // loop over all consumers

   Enumeration e = v.elements();

   while (e.hasMoreElements())
   {
      ic = (ImageConsumer)e.nextElement();

      // send information

      ic.setColorModel(cm);
      ic.setDimensions(x, y);
      ic.setProperties(ht);
      ic.setHints(ImageConsumer.RANDOMPIXELORDER);
      ic.setPixels(0, 0, x, y, cm, rgn, 0, x);
      ic.imageComplete(ImageConsumer.STATICIMAGEDONE);
   }
}

<p><font size="+1"><strong>Creating your own custom image consumer</strong></font><br>

The other half of the producer/consumer model is the image consumer.
Unfortunately, image consumers are nowhere near as glamorous 
as their counterparts; they simply provide front ends for image
filters, image viewers, and a myriad of other tools. Once an image
consumer has added itself to an image producer, as we discussed
earlier, the image producer invokes methods implemented by the
image consumer to route information about the image back to the image
consumer.

<P>
As with the image producer, any class that implements the
<CODE>ImageConsumer</CODE> interface must provide definitions for
certain methods (in this case, seven methods). 
We'll look at each method individually, so that I can provide some
insight as we go along:

<P>
<CODE>public void setHints(int nHints)</CODE>

<P>
Hints are bits of information that describe how an image producer
intends to deliver the image data. A &quot;smart&quot; image consumer
can use this information to enhance its handling of the image
data. An image producer invokes the <CODE>setHints()</CODE> method with
a bit mask composed of the following values: COMPLETESCANLINES,
TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT, RANDOMPIXELORDER, SINGLEFRAME, and SINGLEPASS.
RANDOMPIXELORDER is the most general case.

<P>
<CODE>public void setColorModel(ColorModel cm)</CODE>

<P>
An image producer invokes the <CODE>setColorModel()</CODE> method to
set the default color model for subsequent set-pixel operations.
A color model provides methods for translating from pixel values
to color components.

<P>
<CODE>public void setDimensions(int w, int h)</CODE>

<P>
An image producer invokes the <CODE>setDimensions()</CODE> method to
set the width, height, and properties of the image. These values are
then available via <CODE>Image</CODE> class methods.

<P>
<CODE>public void setProperties(Hashtable htProps)</CODE>

<P>
As with the <CODE>setDimensions()</CODE> method, the image producer 
invokes the <CODE>setProperties()</CODE> method to set the width, 
height, and properties of the image. 

<P>
<CODE>public void setPixels(int x, int y, int w, int h, ColorModel cm,
byte rgb[], int nOffset, int nScansize)</CODE>

<P>
<CODE>public void setPixels(int x, int y, int w, int h, ColorModel cm,
int rgn[], int nOffset, int nScansize)</CODE>

<P>
An image producer invokes the <CODE>setPixels()</CODE> methods to deliver
pixels to an image consumer. The array parameter contains the
pixel values for a rectangular region within the image. The image
producer can reinvoke the method as often as necessary.

<P>
<CODE>public void imageComplete(int nStatus)</CODE><BR>

An image producer invokes the <CODE>imageComplete()</CODE> method to
indicate that either the image reconstruction is complete or
that something went wrong. The status parameter can be one of
the following values: STATICIMAGEDONE, SINGLEFRAMEDONE, IMAGEERROR,
or IMAGEABORTED.

<P>
Listing 4, which is part of a class that monitors the progress of an
image producer, shows the implementation of the
<CODE>imageComplete()</CODE> method along with three of its friends:
<CODE>addImage()</CODE>,  <CODE>waitFor()</CODE>, and
<CODE>run()</CODE> The <CODE>addImage()</CODE> method adds the image
consumer to the image's list of consumers. The <CODE>waitFor()</CODE>
and <CODE>run()</CODE> methods begin image reconstruction within a new
thread while the original thread sleeps. The
<CODE>imageComplete()</CODE> method is called when reconstruction is
complete. It wakes up the original thread, which is now free to use the
image. The complete source code is available 
<A HREF="/javaworld/jw-03-1997/howto/NewImageConsumer.java">here</A>.


<PRE>
public void addImage(Image i)
{
   // add the image consumer

   _ip = i.getSource();

   _ip.addConsumer(this);

   // keep track of the current thread

   _thr = Thread.currentThread();

   _f = false;

   _n = -1;
}

public int waitFor()
{
   // start the thread that will begin image
   //   reconstruction

   new Thread(this).start();

   // suspend until finished

   while (_f == false) _thr.suspend();

   return _n;
}

public void run()
{
   // start reconstruction

   _ip.startProduction(this);
}      

public void imageComplete(int nStatus)
{
   // when reconstruction is finished, restart
   //   the original thread

   _f = true;

   _n = nStatus;

   _ip.removeConsumer(this);

   _thr.resume();
}
