<BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Summary</STRONG><br>
Because an applet's existence is network-based, the designers of the
Java class library had to come up with a system that effectively dealt
with the network delay that exists when pulling images across the
network. The result of their efforts was a system that is certainly
effective, but one that is also a bit confusing. In this column we'll
address some of that confusion. <em>(2,500 words)</em>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<center><img width="432" height="7" src="/javaworld/icons/greenline.gif"></center>

<P>
<font size="+3">P</font>lease indulge me while I let you in on a little
secret (well, it's not really so little): The Java applet is a different
sort of beast from the typical application that executes on your PC or
workstation. For one thing, it doesn't sit quietly on your hard drive
waiting for your attention; a Java applet sits on the other side of a
network connection waiting for you (and many others) to pull it across
the network. Once the applet has made the journey, it comes to life and
begins to download the resources it needs. Unfortunately, all of this
network activity results in one thing:  delay. In contrast to an
application on your hard drive, an applet must expect, and deal
constructively with network delay.

<P>
For this reason, the Java class library was designed to support
asynchronous loading of media, such as images. Asynchronous loading
means that loading occurs out of step with the rest of the application
-- in another thread -- in the background. In fact, what might be
thought of as one operation, the loading of an image from across the
network, actually occurs in two distinct stages, which often occur
asynchronously. These stages are: image definition and the actual
downloading of the image.

<P>
In this column, I will take a close look at the mechanics of image
loading from the perspective of a Java applet or similar network-based
Java application. I will also provide a step-by-step demonstration of
how to load and draw images within an applet.

<P>
But first, let's take a look at the principle players.<P>

<STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">Getting the picture with the Image class</FONT></STRONG><BR>

An instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class represents image data.
The image data does not need to reside locally; it may exist on another
computer. In fact, it may not exist at all. An instance of the
<CODE>Image</CODE> class is more like a reference to image data,
than a container for image data.

<P>
Consider an image on a computer across a network. The creation
of an instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class on a local computer
does not cause the image data to be pulled across the network.
This is true because instantiation of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class
does not cause reconstruction of the image data. The <CODE>Image</CODE>
class doesn't even provide methods for initiating image reconstruction.
(This class does, however, provide access to an <CODE>ImageProducer</CODE>
object that does provide such methods -- I will talk about image
producers next month.)

<P>
Although the <CODE>Image</CODE> class doesn't store image data,
it does provide methods for obtaining information about an image.
The following methods return such information:

<PRE>
int getHeight(ImageObserver obs);

int getWidth(ImageObserver obs);

Object getProperty(String nm, ImageObserver obs);
</PRE>

The height and width values returned from the first two methods
indicate the size of the image, in pixels. Properties, on the other
hand, are image-format-specific pieces of information about an image,
and are retrieved by name. The only property mentioned specifically in
the <CODE>Image</CODE> class API is the <CODE>comment</CODE> property.
It should contain a description of the image, or something similar.
These methods return invalid values (the <CODE>getHeight()</CODE> and
<CODE>getWidth()</CODE> methods both return -1 and the
<CODE>getProperty()</CODE> method returns null) if the desired
information is currently unavailable.

<P>
All three methods require an instance of a class that implements the
<CODE>ImageObserver</CODE> interface as a parameter. An image observer
is an object that expects to be notified when information about an
image becomes available (I will talk about image observers next month).
The <CODE>Applet</CODE> class implements this interface and we'll be
using it as the image observer throughout this column.

<P>
Image objects are not created by instantiating the <CODE>Image</CODE>
class directly. Instead, other classes in the Abstract Windowing
Toolkit  (AWT) provide methods for creating images. For example,
the <CODE>Applet</CODE> class provides methods for creating instances
of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class from a URL:

<PRE>
Image getImage(URL url);

Image getImage(URL url, String nm);
</PRE>

You can also create an instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class with
methods provided by the <CODE>Component</CODE> class:

<PRE>
Image createImage(ImageProducer prod);

Image createImage(int w, int h);
</PRE>

<STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">Drawing images with the Graphics class</FONT></STRONG><BR>

As you might expect, the <CODE>Graphics</CODE> class plays a pivotal
role in the use of images. It would be impossible for me to include a
thorough discussion of the <CODE>Graphics</CODE> class and its role in
the space I have available. Fortunately, my October column was entirely
devoted to the <CODE>Graphics</CODE> class and is available <A
HREF="/javaworld/jw-11-1996/jw-11-howto.html">here</A>.

<P>
Along with methods for drawing text and simple geometric shapes,
the <CODE>Graphics</CODE> class provides methods for drawing images.
In fact, it provides four related methods:

<P>
<CODE>boolean drawImage(Image i, int x, int y, ImageObserver obs);</CODE>
<P>
<CODE>boolean drawImage(Image i, int x, int y, Color c, ImageObserver
obs);</CODE>
<P>
<CODE>boolean drawImage(Image i, int x, int y, int w, int h, Color
c, ImageObserver obs);</CODE>
<P>
<CODE>boolean drawImage(Image i, int x, int y, int w, int h, ImageObserver
obs);</CODE>

<P>
These methods have several parameters in common. Each method requires
an instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class and the x and
y coordinates at which to draw the image. Each method also requires
an instance of a class that implements the <CODE>ImageObserver</CODE>
interface.<P>

<STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">Stepping through the motions</FONT></STRONG><BR>

I think its time to put our feet to the fire and construct an applet
that loads and draws an image. To help you better understand the
techniques required to draw images, we will work through the process in
several stages, examining each in detail.<P>
  
<STRONG>Creating an instance of Image</STRONG><BR>

Our first step is to create an instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class. Remember, instantiating the <CODE>Image</CODE> class
<em>does not</em> cause the image to be reconstructed locally; that is, it does
not cause the applet to download the image data.

<P>
<PRE>
public void init()
{
   // getDocumentBase() returns the URL of the document
   //   that contains this applet
   im = getImage(getDocumentBase(), &quot;fig.gif&quot;);
      .
      .
      .
}
</PRE>

<P>
This code demonstrates how to use the <CODE>Applet</CODE>
class's <CODE>getImage()</CODE> method to create a reference to image
data located somewhere else on the network. <CODE>getImage()</CODE>
requires either an instance of the <CODE>URL</CODE> class
identifying the location of the image data, or an instance of
the <CODE>URL</CODE> class identifying the document base and a
string containing the filename of the image data. I used the
latter of the two.<P>

<STRONG>Downloading an image</STRONG><BR>

After creating an instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class, our next
step is to reconstruct the image data itself -- on this side of the
network. Image reconstruction is initiated via a call to the
<CODE>prepareImage()</CODE> method of the instance of the
<CODE>Component</CODE> class upon which the image is to be drawn. The following code demonstrates how to use the <CODE>Component</CODE>
class's <CODE>prepareImage()</CODE> method to begin reconstruction of
the image data:

<P>
<PRE>
public void init()
{
   // getDocumentBase() returns the URL of the document
   //   that contains this applet
   im = getImage(getDocumentBase(), &quot;fig.gif&quot;);
   // since this is an applet, &quot;this&quot; refers to an instance
   //   of the Applet class... which just happens to be an
   //   image observer
   prepareImage(im, this);
      .
      .
      .
}
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>prepareImage()</CODE> method requires an instance
of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class representing the image, and an
instance of a class that implements the <CODE>ImageObserver</CODE>
interface. The latter requirement is satisfied by the <CODE>Applet</CODE>
class, which happens to be an image observer.

<P>
As it turns out, the call to the <CODE>prepareImage()</CODE> method
is not strictly necessary in this example because the call to
the <CODE>drawImage()</CODE> method that we are about to make will start
the reconstruction by itself. Let's see what this is all about.<P>

<STRONG>Drawing an Image</STRONG><BR>

As I mentioned before, the loading of an image occurs asynchronously --
in the background, so to speak. This fact, however, doesn't prevent us
from attempting to draw the incompletely loaded image.  Drawing is
accomplished via a call to the <CODE>Graphics</CODE> class's
<CODE>drawImage()</CODE> method. Notice that I use the
<CODE>Graphics</CODE> class's <CODE>drawImage()</CODE> method from
within the context of a component's <CODE>paint()</CODE> method:
 
<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{
   // because this is an applet, &quot;this&quot; refers to an instance
   //   of the Applet class... which just happens to be an
   //   image observer
   g.drawImage(im, 50, 50, this);
      .
      .
      .
}
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>drawImage()</CODE> method requires an instance of the
<CODE>Image</CODE> class representing the image, the x and y coordinates
at which to draw the image, and an instance of a class that implements
the <CODE>ImageObserver</CODE> interface.

<P>
If the applet attempts to draw an image before the image is fully
reconstructed, a partial image will be drawn. In fact, if you have an extremely slow Internet connection, the applet, which is shown
in Figure 1, will allow you to observe this effect. The applet
will redraw the image every time more of the image arrives. In
order to see what I'm talking about, you might need to
have your browser reload the current document.

<P>
The code demonstrating the previous three techniques is available
<A HREF="/javaworld/jw-02-1997/howto/Test1.java">here</A>.<P>

<STRONG>Preventing incomplete drawing</STRONG><BR>
Generally speaking, a truly elegant applet should not draw an image
until all the image data is available, so we need a way to ensure that
this is the case. To get started, we'll use a technique that works best
for applets displaying a single image. This technique, which is shown
in the following code snippet, uses the <CODE>Component</CODE> class's
<CODE>checkImage()</CODE> method to determine whether or not an image
has finished loading. We'll discuss a more comprehensive mechanism to
prevent incomplete drawing in the next section.

<p>
<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{
   // because this is an applet, &quot;this&quot; refers to an instance
   //   of the Applet class... which just happens to be an
   //   image observer
   int n = checkImage(im, this) &amp; ImageObserver.ALLBITS;
   // the return value consists of a set of bits describing the
   //   state of the image reconstruction
   if (n == ImageObserver.ALLBITS) g.drawImage(im, 50, 50, this);
      .
      .
      .
}
</PRE>

<P>
Here we see how to use the <CODE>Component</CODE>
class's <CODE>checkImage()</CODE> method in conjunction with the <CODE>Graphics</CODE>
class's <CODE>drawImage()</CODE> method. <CODE>checkImage()</CODE>
requires an instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class representing
the image and an instance of a class that implements the <CODE>ImageObserver</CODE>
interface. It returns an integer describing the state of the reconstruction.

<P>
In this example, the applet must determine whether or not all of
the image data is available before attempting to draw the image. It
does so by testing to see whether or not the ALLBITS bit is set in the
returned data (other bits include the ABORT, ERROR, FRAMEBITS, HEIGHT,
WIDTH, SOMEBITS, and PROPERTIES bits). If ALLBITS is set, the applet
knows that all of the image data has been loaded.

<P>
The applet in Figure 2 shows this code in action. Once again,
it might be necessary to have your browser reload the current
document. The code for this applet is available <A HREF="/javaworld/jw-02-1997/howto/Test3.java">here</A>.

<P>

<APPLET codebase="/javaworld/jw-02-1997/howto"

	width="400"
	height="300">
<strong>You need a Java-enabled browser to see this applet.</strong>
</APPLET>

<P>
<center><em>Figure: 2 Waiting for the image data to load</em></center><P>

<STRONG> <FONT SIZE="+1">Monitoring image loading with the MediaTracker class</FONT></STRONG><BR>

In an applet with more that a few images to download, <em>ad hoc</em>
techniques like the one we just discussed come up short. The
<CODE>MediaTracker</CODE> class provides an easier, more comprehensive
solution for monitoring image loading.

<P>
The <CODE>MediaTracker</CODE> class provides three clear
advantages over the previous approach:
<UL>
<LI>Images may be organized into groups
<LI>Loading may occur synchronously or asynchronously
<LI>Groups may be loaded independent of any other groups
</UL>
Let's take a look at the code:

<P>
<PRE>
public void init()
{
   // in this case, &quot;this&quot; refers to a subclass of the
   //   Component class, which the Applet class just happens
   //   to be
   MediaTracker mt = new MediaTracker(this);

   im = getImage(getDocumentBase(), &quot;fig.gif&quot;);

   // add the image to group #0
   mt.addImage(im, 0);

   try
   {
      // wait for all of the images to load
      mt.waitForAll();
   }
   catch (InterruptedException ie)
   {
      ;
   }
}
</PRE>

<P>
Let's take a closer look at what's going on here. First, an instance of
the <CODE>MediaTracker</CODE> class is created. The constructor
requires that the component in which the image will be drawn be passed
as a parameter.

<P>
Each image to be tracked is added via the <CODE>addImage()</CODE> method.
The second parameter indicates the group to which the image must be
added. The <CODE>waitForAll()</CODE> method instructs the
<CODE>MediaTracker</CODE> object to begin reconstructing all images,
and to return when the process is finished.

<P>
A handy feature of the <CODE>MediaTracker</CODE> class is its ability to monitor individual image groups; it allows the applet to load them once the entire group's data is available. This technique is helpful when you have a lot of images to load but not all of the images have to be displayed up front. 

<P>
The applet in Figure 3 shows this code in action. Again,
it might be necessary to have your browser reload the current
document. The code for this applet is available <A HREF="/javaworld/jw-02-1997/howto/Test4.java">here</A>.

<P>
<center>

<strong><font size="+1">Conclusion</font></strong><br>

By now, you might suspect that there is more to this image business than
meets the eye -- and you'd be correct. Next month I will stroll
behind the scenes to take a look at the classes that make all of
this work. In the meantime, try to incorporate some of the material
from prior columns (events, for instance) and see if you can't make
something <em>really</em> interesting. As always, keep the feedback coming.
