<STRONG>Summary</STRONG><BR>
Images don't have to stand still. They can move. Unfortunately, using
the basic Java language class library, you can't display images like
the output of a video feed or even an animated GIF, which has become so
commonplace on the Web. Not wanting you to be left in the dark ages, I
have set out this month to show you can manipulate the Java language
class library to create animated <CODE>Image</CODE> objects. When we're
done, you'll have not only a useful piece of software, but a much
better understanding of two components of the Java language class
library. <EM>(1,750 words)</EM>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>
<A HREF="/javaworld/jw-02-1997/jw-02-howto.html">Two months ago</A> I
showed you how to create an instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class
given the URL of a file containing image data. Then, in <A
HREF="/javaworld/jw-03-1997/jw-03-howto.html">last month's column</A>,
I showed you how to create an instance of the <CODE>Image</CODE> class
given an instance of a class that implemented the
<CODE>ImageProducer</CODE> interface. In both examples the rest of the
application didn't know (or care, for that matter) how the
<CODE>Image</CODE> object was created.

<P>
Let's examine the second case in a bit more detail.

<P>
True to its name, an image producer produces image data. The image
producer in last month's column produced an image showing a color
gradient. However, an image producer is not limited to generating (and
regenerating) only a single, static frame of image data; in fact, it is
free to redefine the image data <EM>at any time</EM>.

<P>
Perhaps you can guess where I am going with this. After an image producer
has produced one frame of image data, it is free to draw right on top of
that frame to produce yet another frame of image data. Repeat this process
a couple of times and, bam, you've got animation.

<P>
Whoah! Animation that easy? You bet. Let's take a closer look at how we
can actually do this repetitive drawing.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The mechanics</FONT></STRONG><BR>

Take a look at the illustration below, which shows the relationship
between an image producer and one or more image consumers. As you know
from our previous discussions, the image producer communicates
information about the image data it is producing to one or more image
consumers by invoking public methods on the image consumer. Image
consumers then use this image information in a variety of ways -- to
draw the image on the screen, for example. If you're feeling little
lost about the whole concept of image producers and image consumers,
take a quick detour back to <A
HREF="/javaworld/jw-03-1997/jw-03-howto.html">last month's column</A>
before we move on.

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="/javaworld/jw-04-1997/howto/fig1.gif" HEIGHT=106 WIDTH=426></CENTER>

<P>
<CENTER><EM>The image producer/image consumer relationship</CENTER></EM>

<P>
The interface between an image producer and an image consumer dictates
the type of images that can be produced. With that in mind, let's look
at two of the methods the <CODE>ImageConsumer</CODE> interface defines and
the parameters those methods expect. The methods are the <CODE>setHints()</CODE>
and <CODE>imageComplete()</CODE> methods. Let's begin at the end with the <CODE>imageComplete()</CODE> method, shown next: 

<P>
<CODE>imageComplete(int nStatus)</CODE>

<P>
When an image producer calls an image consumer's
<CODE>imageComplete()</CODE> method, it does so with the intent of
informing the consumer about the status of the image reconstruction.
The <CODE>imageComplete()</CODE> method requires an integer argument, which can be one of four values: <CODE>IMAGEABORTED</CODE>, <CODE>IMAGEERROR</CODE>, <CODE>STATICIMAGEDONE</CODE>, and <CODE>SINGLEFRAMEDONE</CODE>.

<P>
An image producer uses the arguments <CODE>IMAGEABORTED</CODE> and
<CODE>IMAGEERROR</CODE> to indicate that something has gone wrong
during the process of image production.  It uses the argument
<CODE>STATICIMAGEDONE</CODE> to indicate that image production is
completely finished. Last of all, but central to our plan, it uses the
argument <CODE>SINGLEFRAMEDONE</CODE> to indicate that it has produced
a single frame of image data, but more frames may follow.

<P>
The following snippet demonstrates how an image producer
would indicate to an image consumer that image production is complete.

<PRE>
public void startProduction(ImageConsumer ic)
{
      .
      .
   // image production code goes here...
      .
      .
   ic.imageComplete(ImageConsumer.STATICIMAGEDONE);
      .
      .
}
</PRE>


<P>
Now let's skip back to the beginning and examine the
<CODE>setHints()</CODE> method, shown here:

<P><CODE>setHints(int nHints)</CODE>

<P>
Before image production begins, an image producer can tell the image
consumer a little bit about how it intends to deliver the image data
with "hints." The image consumer can use this information to optimize
its processing of the image data. Image producers can specify five
hints, which can be combined, to let an image consumer know what's
coming: <CODE>RANDOMPIXELORDER</CODE>, <CODE>COMPLETESCANLINES</CODE>,
<CODE>TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT</CODE>, <CODE>SINGLEFRAME</CODE>, and
<CODE>SINGLEPASS</CODE>.

<P>
An image producer uses the argument <CODE>RANDOMPIXELORDER</CODE> to
indicate that it will deliver the image data in an unpredictable order
(this is the default). It uses the argument
<CODE>COMPLETESCANLINES</CODE> to indicate that it will deliver the
image data one scan line at a time. The argument
<CODE>TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT</CODE> indicates that the image producer will
deliver the image data in a top-down and left-to-right fashion. And
finally, the arguments <CODE>SINGLEFRAME</CODE> and
<CODE>SINGLEPASS</CODE> indicate that the image data will consist of
only a single frame and that it will set a particular pixel's data only
one time. An image producer should not send the last two hints if it
intends to produce more than one frame of image data.

<P>
The following snippet demonstrates how an image producer
would indicate to an image consumer how it intends to deliver image data.

<PRE>
public void startProduction(ImageConsumer ic)
{
      .
      .
   ic.setHints(ImageConsumer.RANDOMPIXELORDER);
      .
      .
   // image production code goes here...
      .
      .
}
</PRE>

<P>
The flowchart displayed below shows the steps an image producer must
take when sending multiframe image data to image consumers. Here's what
happens. An image producer must first communicate hints and related
information to any image consumers that are interested in that
information. It then must send the image data for the first frame. As
each frame is completed, the image producer invokes the image
consumer's <CODE>imageComplete()</CODE> method with the argument
<CODE>SINGLEFRAMEDONE</CODE>. It then sends image data for the next
frame, and so on. When the image producer has finished sending all the
frames, it invokes the image consumer's <CODE>imageComplete()</CODE>
method with the argument <CODE>STATICIMAGEDONE</CODE>.

<CENTER><EM>An image producer's flow of control</EM></CENTER>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Getting down to the code</FONT></STRONG><BR>

Because all of the hard work of image handling is done within the image
producer, the application itself doesn't require any significant
modifications. The image created from the custom image producer plugs
into an application just like any other image. The code listing <EM>A
framework for displaying an image</EM> shows the framework we used last
month for displaying an image, with one small change.  The
<CODE>createImage()</CODE> method now takes as a parameter an instance
of the new image producer. No additional machinery is required.

<PRE>
public class Framework extends Applet
{
   private Image _im = null;

   public void init()
   {
      // createImage() creates an image from an
      //   image producer object...
      _im = createImage(new NewImageProducer());

      // because this is an applet, &quot;this&quot; refers to an
      //   instance of the Applet class... which just
      //   happens to be an image observer...
      prepareImage(_im, this);
   }

   public void paint(Graphics g)
   {
      // see the comment about &quot;this&quot; above... 
      g.drawImage(_im, 50, 50, this);
   }
}
</PRE>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Applying the techniques</FONT></STRONG><BR>

The applet in this section demonstrates this technique in
action. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to provide a video feed for this
column (although that certainly would have been impressive), so I had
to find another way to illustrate the techniques we reviewed this
month. After much thought and diligent searching, I came up with the
Mandelbrot generator applet, which I happen to think is really neat.

<P>
<applet codebase="/javaworld/jw-04-1997/howto/"
        code="New.class" 
        width="532" 
        height="532">
You need a Java-enabled browser to see this applet.
</applet>

<P>
<CENTER><EM>A Mandelbrot generator</CENTER></EM>


<P><a name="mandelbrot"><p></a>

The image producer in this example produces an image of the Mandelbrot
set. If you're wondering what the heck that is, be sure to read the
sidebar <strong><a href="#sidebar">The Mandelbrot set</a></strong> for
more information.  The image producer first produces a rough,
low-resolution image, which it enhances with each successive frame. In
this way, the viewer is treated to continually &quot;better&quot;
approximations of the image without having to wait until the full image
is generated (which is, let me warn you now, a time-consuming
process).

<p>
The complete source code for the Mandelbrot image producer is available
<A
HREF="/javaworld/jw-04-1997/howto/MandelbrotImageProducer.java">here</A>.
The complete source code of the applet is available <A
HREF="/javaworld/jw-04-1997/howto/New.java">here</A>.

<P>
<font size="+1"><strong>Wrapping up</font></strong><BR>

A framework like the one shown previously is really all that is
required to display the image. I recommend that you take the image
producer out for a whirl and drop it into some of your code in place of
a static image. Go ahead, give it a try. If you come across any serious problems, you can always contact <A NAME="author" HREF="/javaworld/cgi-bin/jw-mailto.cgi?todd.sundsted@javaworld.com+/javaworld/jw-04-1997/jw-04-howto.html+author">me</A> (todd.sundsted@javaworld.com) with whatever's holding you up.

<P>
Next month I'll be launching the first of a multipart series on 3D
graphics in Java. 3D graphics engines are at the heart of a widely
diverse set of applications from computer aided design software to
games. They're also an essential element of any virtual reality
environment. So stick around and I'll show you how to create
your own little virtual 3D world.

<P><CENTER><strong><font size="+1">The Mandelbrot set</a></font></strong></center>

<P>
The Mandelbrot set is one of the best-known examples of a fractal.
It's so well known that even if you haven't heard of it, you've almost
certainly seen it.

<P>
All fractals share one important characteristic--they are self-similar
at all levels of magnification.  This means that the closer you look
at a fractal, the more detail you see--and the detail seen close up
looks just like the detail seen far away.

<P>
Contrast this with most things we are familiar with--my lawn, for
example, looks like a hilly green carpet when viewed from my living
room window.  However, when I view it from an inch or two away, the
hills disappear and individual blades of grass appear.  I don't see
smaller and smaller hills.

<P>
The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers.  A complex number
belongs in the Mandelbrot set if the passes (or fails, depending on
how you look at it) a simple test.

<P>
Take any complex number c and run it through the following equation (z
is initially zero):

<CODE><P>f(z) = z * z + c</CODE>

<P>
Replace the previous value of z with the result and run c through
again. Repeat this procedure. Eventually, one of two things will
happen. Either the magnitude of the result will begin to grow larger
and larger (at which point we quit and say the number <EM>is not
in</EM> the Mandelbrot set), or, after a large number of iterations,
the magnitude won't grow larger and larger (at which point we give up
and say the number <EM>is in</EM> the Mandelbrot set).

<P>
We can plot the resulting set by treating the real part of the complex
number as the x coordinate and the imaginary part of the complex
number as the y coordinate. The complex numbers found in the
Mandelbrot set are usually colored black. Numbers not in the
Mandelbrot set are colored according to the number of iterations
required before we decide they're not in the set.

<P>
The most interesting thing about the Mandelbrot set is the incredible
complexity that results from such a simple algorithm. At first glance,
the resulting plot looks like a cardioid with warts. If you look at the warts,
however, you see that they have warts and creeping tendrils. Look at
the tendrils and you'll find miniature versions of the original
cardioid, also resplendent with warts. And on and on it goes.
