    <p>Open 18 is an application which allows you to record a
    personal record of your golfing history. It offers a place to store
    course information and the details of the rounds played on those
    courses. The application includes business objects such as Course,
    Tee, Hole, Round and Player. The domain model covers a rich
    cross-section of entities, associations, collections, and
    validations.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this example application is to demonstrate the benefits
    that Seam can provide above and beyond the standard JSF offerings.  It
    also makes use of the Spring framework, since a majority of applications built
    today also depend on this valuable and productive framework.  Despite the
    use of Seam, this application does not require an EJB 3.0 container at all.
    Rather, it can be run from simple servlet containers such as Tomcat and Jetty.</p>
