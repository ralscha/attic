        The application context is used to configure components and services within
        the platform.  The platform defines a number of "magic" bean names that it
        uses to locate specific components, so they must be named exactly as shown.
        These magic beans are identified in the documentation below and they are
        marked as required or optional.
        
        This may look a little daunting at first, but hang in there.  The good news
        is that you don't have to change many of the bean configurations provided
        here when you are setting up your application.
        
        Typically, you would change the following:
        
        1. The startingPageId on the lifecycleAdvisor.
        2. The eventExceptionHandler on the lifecycleAdvisor (or remove it if you
           don't want to use it).
        3. Specify the location of your resource bundle in the messageSource.
        4. Specify the mapping properties files for images in imageResourcesFactory.
        5. Specify your rulesSource class, if you're using one.
        6. Configure your view beans.

        Bean: application
        Type: magic
        Usage: required
        Description: This defines the singleton application instance to be used.
            Note that, currently, this object is not pluggable.  You must use the
            class specified below and configure it as needed.

    <!-- 
        Bean: lifecycleAdvisor
        Type: user named
        Usage: required
        Description: This defines the LifecycleAdvisor instance to be used by the
            Application.  Note the reference to this bean in the constructor
            args in the application bean.  If you don't need any special handling
            in the application lifecycle, then you could use the provided default
            advisor in
            org.springframework.richclient.application.config.DefaultApplicationLifecycleAdvisor
            
            Two key properties must be configured, the location of the file containing
            the command definitions for application windows and the bean id of the
            page that should be displayed initially upon application startup, you
            can find the referenced view bean toward the bottom of this file.
            
            An optional, but highly recommended, property you can set is the
            eventExceptionHandler.  If specified, this will be registered with the
            AWT event thread as the handler to receive uncaught exceptions that occur
            on the event thread.

            you should just include this as is.

            constructed via the platform.  This is a critical part of the I18N support.
            Unless you have very special needs, you should use the default implementation,
            as is done here.  The implementation is configured with three other
            components responsible for providing I18N messages, images, and icons.

            components that are configured according to the platform standards.
            This is a critical part of the I18N support.
            If you have special needs when constructing UI controls, then you
            may need to override the default implementation.
            The imlpementation is configured with two other
            components responsible for providing I18N messages and icons.

        Bean: lookAndFeelConfigurer
        Type: magic
        Usage: platform optional
        Description: The platform doesn't specifically make direct use of this
            object (other than instantiating it).  It is expected that the object
            will register itself into the UI Manager when it is instantiated in
            the context.  Take a look at the JGoodiesLooksConfigurer class for an
            example of this.

        Description: This specifies the component that is responsible for providing
            messages (all kinds of text) to the platform.  This is a critical piece
            of the I18N support.  Unless your doing something very unusual, the
            ResourceBundleMessageSource used below should be sufficient.  Just
            configure it with the base names of the resource bundles you want to
            use in your application.  Unless you want to override the default
            text resources for the platform, you should include
            org.springframework.richclient.application.messages as the last base name.

        Description: This specifies the component that is responsible for providing

            files to map image resource keys to image locations.

        Description: This specifies the component that is responsible for providing
            images to the platform.  It makes use of a resource factory that converts
            the image keys to resource locations.  The DefaultImageSource also provides
            a "broken image" image for any requested image that can't be found or fails
            to load.

        Bean: formComponentInterceptorFactory
        Type: magic
        Usage: platform optional
        Description: This specifies the list of interceptors to attach to controls
            constructed by the platform.  This allows for a declarative model for
            specifying "additional" functionality to be added to various components.
            The configuration below adds interceptors to overlay validation error
            images and background color changes, provide popup menus in text fields, 
            and autocompletion (as you type) for comboboxes.

        Type: user named
        Usage: application
        Description: This specifies the component that describes the initial view
            to present when the application is started.  The application window
            uses a ViewDescriptor to define the view to be presented.  The
            ViewDescriptor is then configured with the name of the class that
            provides the view and any properties to be configured on the view instance
            when it is created.
