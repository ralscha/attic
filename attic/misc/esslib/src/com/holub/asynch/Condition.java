/**
 *	This class implements a simple "condition variable." The notion
 *	is that a thread waits for some condition to become true.
 *	If the condition is false, then no wait occurs.
 *
 *	Be very careful of nested-monitor-lockout here:
 * <pre>
 *	 class lockout
 *	 {	Condition godot = new Condition(false);
 *	 
 *	 	synchronized void f()
 *	 	{	
 *	 		some_code();
 *	 		godot.wait_for_true();
 *	 	}
 *	 
 *	 	synchronized void set() // <b>Deadlock if another thread is in f()</b>
 *	 	{	godot.set_true();
 *	 	}
 *	 }
 * </pre>
 *	You enter f(), locking the monitor, then block waiting for the
 *  condition to become true. Note that you have not released the
 *  monitor for the "lockout" object.
 *	[The only way to set <code>godot</code> true
 *  is to call <code>set()</code>, but you'll block on entry
 *  to <code>set()</code> because
 *	the original caller to <code>f()</code> has the monitor
 *	containing "lockout" object.]
 *	<p>Solve the problem by releasing the monitor before waiting:
 * <pre>
 *	 class okay
 *	 {	Condition godot = new Condition(false);
 *	 
 *	 	void f()
 *	 	{	synchronized( this )
 *	 		{	some_code();
 *	 		}
 *	 		godot.wait_for_true();	// <b>Move the wait outside the monitor</b>
 *	 	}
 *	 
 *	 	synchronized void set()
 *	 	{	godot.set_true();
 *	 	}
 *	 }
 * </pre>
 * or by not synchronizing the <code>set()</code> method:
 * <pre>
 *	 class okay
 *	 {	Condition godot = new Condition(false);
 *	 
 *	 	synchronized void f()
 *	 	{	some_code();
 *	 		godot.wait_for_true();
 *	 	}
 *	 
 *	 	void set()				// <b>Remove the synchronized statement</b>
 *	 	{	godot.set_true();
 *	 	}
 *	}
 * </pre>
 * The normal <code>wait()</code>/<code>notify()</code> mechanism
 * doesn't have this problem since
 * <code>wait()</code> releases the monitor,
 * but you can't always use <code>wait()</code>/<code>notify()</code>.
