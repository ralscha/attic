<h2>Introduction</h2> 

The JavaLog is a set of Java classes that formats and writes events to
one or more log devices.&nbsp; JavaLog frees the programmer from
coding unflexible "print" statements in his code.&nbsp; It offers an
abstract interface to the various log devices and allows the user to
configure each log device at run time.&nbsp; Additionally, JavaLog
allows the user to dynamically filter and format the logged events to
suit his particular needs at run time.

<p>For example, if the programmer logs events to JavaLog, the user
may, at run time, decided that he wants to see error events in a
pop-up dialog box, warning events written to a file, and informational
events on the standard output.&nbsp; Additionally, for each type of
event (errors, warnings, notices, traces, or user defined) he may
specify a format in which each event should be logged.

<p>The programmer's job is simple:
<blockquote><tt>import grace.log.Log;</tt>
<br><tt>...</tt>
<br><tt>public void foobar() {</tt>
<br><b><tt><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log.trace("hey!");</font></tt></b>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
The resulting program will then produce the following:
<blockquote><tt>03/07/99 17:02:48: 13: trace: system.main.Thread1: Test.foobar:54:
"hey!"</tt></blockquote>

Yes, it's just that simple!&nbsp; Notice that in the preceding call to
Log.trace(data),&nbsp; JavaLog printed out the String <i>"MyData"</i>
and automatically determined and logged the following:

    <ul>
    <li>Time
    <li>Event sequence number
    <li>Event type
    <li>Thread group(s) and thread name
    <li>Classname, function, and line number whence the log event was generated
    </ul>
